<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>

<p>With this volume begins a new series of adventures
for the “Motor Boys.” Under the title
“Ned, Bob and Jerry at Boxwood Hall; Or, The
Motor Boys as Freshmen,” I have had the pleasure
of writing for you the various happenings that
took place when the three young men, whose activities
you have followed for some time, entered
a new field.</p>

<p>The fathers of Ned Slade and Bob Baker, and
the mother of Jerry Hopkins, in consultation one
day, decided that the young men were getting a
bit too wild and frivolous.</p>

<p>“It is time they settled down,” said their parents,
“and began to think of growing up. Let’s
send them to college!”</p>

<p>And to the college of Boxwood Hall our heroes
were sent. It was a surprise to them, but it
turned out to be a delightful surprise, and one of
the reasons was that their old friend, Professor
Snodgrass, now an enthusiastic collector of butterflies,
was an instructor at Boxwood.</p>

<p>Of what took place at the college, of the hazing,
the initiation, the queer developments following
an automobile rescue, of how the motor
boys gradually overcame an unfair prejudice, and
how they helped to win a baseball victory—for
all this I refer you to the following pages. The
titles of the second series will include the names
Ned, Bob and Jerry, in various activities, and
while they will still use their motors, in auto, boat
or airship, those machines will be of secondary
consideration.</p>

<p>And with this explanation, and with the hope
that you will accord this book the same welcome
you have given my other writings, I remain,</p>

<p class="noic">Sincerely yours,</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>THE OVERTURNED AUTO</small></h2>


<p>“What do you reckon it’s all about, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Well, Bob, you’re as good a guesser as I am,”
came the answer from the young man who was
at the wheel of a touring car that was swinging
down a pleasant country road, under arching trees.
“What do you say it means?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea, unless it’s some business
deal. Ned, why don’t you say something,
instead of sitting there like a goldfish being admired
by a tom-cat?” and Bob Baker, who sat
beside Jerry Hopkins, the lad at the wheel, turned
to his chum in the rear seat of the car.</p>

<p>“Say something!” exclaimed Ned Slade. “I’m
as much up in the air about it as you fellows are.
All I know is that my dad, and yours, and Jerry’s
mother, are having a confab.”</p>

<p>“And a sort of serious confab at that,” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Bob. “Look out there, Jerry!” he cried suddenly.
“You nearly ran over that chicken,” and
he involuntarily raised his hand toward the steering
wheel as a frightened, squawking and cackling
hen fluttered from under the front wheels of
the automobile, shedding feathers on the way.
Then Bob remembered one of the first ethics of
automobiling, which is never to interfere with the
steersman, and he drew back his hand.</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile,” remarked Jerry
coolly, as he brought the car back to a straight
course, for he had swerved it to one side when
he saw the chicken in the path. “But I agree
with you, Bob, that the conference going on at
my house, among our respected, and I might as
well say respectable, parents does seem to be a
serious one. However, as long as we can’t guess
what it’s about there’s no use in worrying. We
may as well have a good time this afternoon.
Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to Wallace’s and have a bite to eat,”
put in Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, we only just had lunch!” exclaimed Ned,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Maybe you fellows did, but I wouldn’t call it
a lunch that I got outside of—not by a long shot!
Mother isn’t at home, it was the girl’s day out
and I had to forage for myself.”</p>

<p>“Heaven help the pantry, then!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Jerry. “I’ve seen Bob ‘forage,’ as he calls it,
before; eh, Ned?”</p>

<p>“That’s right. He did it at our house once,
and say! what mother said when she came home—whew!”
and Ned whistled at the memory.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t a bit worse than you were!” cried
Bob, trying to lean back and punch his chum, but
the latter kept out of reach in the roomy tonneau.
“Anyhow, what has that got to do with going to
Wallace’s now? I’m hungry and I don’t care
who knows it.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let that fat waiter at Wallace’s
hear you say that, or he’ll double charge us in the
bill,” cautioned Jerry. “They sure do stick on
the prices at that joint.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll go there?” asked Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I s’pose we might as well go there as
anywhere. Does it suit you, Ned?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Only I can’t imagine where Bob puts
it all. Tell us, Chunky, that’s a good chap,” and
he patted the shoulder of the stout lad who sat
in front of him.</p>

<p>“Tell you what?” asked Bob, responding to the
nickname that had been bestowed on him because
of his stoutness.</p>

<p>“Where you put all you eat,” went on Ned
with a laugh. “You know it is impossible to make
two objects occupy the same space at the same
time. And if you’ve eaten one lunch to-day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
not two hours ago, where are you going to put
another?”</p>

<p>“You watch and see,” was all the answer Bob
made. “Hit her up a bit, Jerry. There’s a stiff
hill just ahead.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I forgot we were on this road.
Well, then it’s settled. We’ll go to Wallace’s
and let Bob eat,” and having ascended the hill, he
turned off on a road that led to a summer resort
not many miles from Cresville, the home town of
the three lads.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you fellows going to have anything?”
asked Bob. “You’ll eat; won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, for cats’ sake, cut out the grub-talk for a
while!” begged Ned. “Say, what about that conference,
anyhow? Does any one know anything
about it?”</p>

<p>“All I know,” said Jerry, “is that I asked
mother to come out for an auto ride this afternoon,
and she said she couldn’t because your dad,
Ned, and Bob’s too, were coming over to call.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask her what for?”</p>

<p>“No, but I took it for granted it was something
about business. You know mother owns some
stock in your father’s department store, Ned.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and she deposits at dad’s bank,” added
Bob, whose father, Andrew Baker, was the president
of the most important bank in Cresville. “I
guess it must be about some business affairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“Why not?” Jerry demanded. “When mother
said she couldn’t come out I hustled over and
got you fellows, and here we are. But what’s
your reason for thinking it isn’t business, Ned,
that has brought our folks together at my house?”</p>

<p>“Because of some questions my father asked me
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Serious questions?” Bob interrogated.</p>

<p>“Well, in a way, yes. He asked me what I’d
been doing lately, what you fellows had been doing,
and he wanted to know what my plans were
for this winter.”</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?” inquired Jerry, slowing
down as he came to the crest of another hill.</p>

<p>“Oh, I said we hadn’t decided yet. I didn’t
tell him we had talked over making a tour of the
South, for we hadn’t quite decided on it; had
we?”</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” responded Jerry. “And yet the
South is the place when winter comes. I guess
we might do worse.”</p>

<p>“Well, I didn’t say anything about that,” went
on Ned, “because, if I had, dad would have wanted
to know all the particulars, and I wasn’t in a
position to tell him.”</p>

<p>“Is that all he asked you that makes you think
the conference may be about us, instead of business?”
Bob inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, that wasn’t quite all. He asked me about
that trouble we got into last week.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you mean about the time we were
pulled in for speeding?” asked Jerry with a laugh.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” assented Ned. “Only it isn’t going
to be anything to grin at if dad finds out all about
it—that we nearly collided with the hay wagon
while trying to pass that roadster. Say, but it
was some going! We fractured the speed limits
in half a dozen places.”</p>

<p>“But we beat the roadster!” exclaimed Jerry.
“That fellow didn’t know how to drive a car.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there. And, for a second or two,
I thought you were going to make a mess of it,”
said Ned, referring to an incident that had happened
about a week previously when the boys, out
on the road in their car, had accepted an impromptu
challenge to race, with what might have
been disastrous results.</p>

<p>“It was a narrow squeak,” admitted Jerry.</p>

<p>“And the nerve of that farmer, setting the constable
after us!” cried Bob. “Just because we
wouldn’t let him rob us of ten dollars to make up
for a scratch one of his horses got from our mud
guard.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes think we might have come out
of it better if we had given the hayseeder his ten,”
said Jerry, reflectively. “It cost us fifteen for the
speed-fine as it was. We’d have saved five.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“And is that what your father was asking
about?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Words to that effect—yes,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>“Wonder how he heard about it?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t in the paper,” reflected Jerry. “I
looked all over for an account of it, but didn’t
see any.”</p>

<p>“No, it wasn’t in the paper,” said Ned, “but
dad hears of more things than I think he does, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“We have been speeding it up a bit lately,” observed
Jerry in a reflective tone.</p>

<p>“Just a little,” admitted Ned, with a half smile.</p>

<p>The three chums were clean-cut, healthy-looking
lads, and it needed but a glance into their clear
faces to tell one that whatever “speeding” they
had been doing was in a literal sense only, and
was not in the way of dissipation. They were fun-loving
youths, and, like all such, the excitement of
the moment sometimes got the better of them.</p>

<p>“And so you think the conference may have
something to do with us; is that it, Ned?” asked
Jerry, after a moment or two of silence.</p>

<p>“I have an idea that way—yes, from what dad
said, and from what he wanted to know about our
future plans. We’re mixed up in it somehow,
that’s as sure as turkey and cranberry sauce.”</p>

<p>“That sounds like Chunky!” laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the idea?” demanded the stout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
youth. “I mean—what do you think will happen,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know we have been going a pretty
lively gait lately, nothing wrong, of course, but a
sort of butterfly existence, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“Butterfly is good!” exclaimed Jerry. “You’d
think we were a trio of society girls.”</p>

<p>“Well, I mean we haven’t really done anything
worth while,” went on Ned. “And it’s my idea
that my dad, and yours, Bob, and Jerry’s mother,
who is as good a dad as any fellow could want—I
think they are going to put the brakes on us.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” Jerry demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, make us cut out some of the gay and carefree
life we’ve been living. Settle down and——”</p>

<p>“Get married?” laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Not much!” cried Bob. “Not if I can help
it!”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” put in Ned. “I mean just
settle down a bit, that’s all.”</p>

<p>They swung around a curve in the road, and
as they did so they saw a powerful roadster coming
toward them, driven by a man who was the
sole occupant. He was speeding forward at a
fast clip.</p>

<p>“That fellow had better settle down!” exclaimed
Jerry. “He’s going too fast to make this
turn, and this bank is one of the most dangerous
around here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys themselves had safely taken the turn,
and come past the steep embankment on which it
bordered, but the man in the roadster was approaching
it.</p>

<p>“He isn’t slowing down,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Better yell at him,” suggested Bob. “Maybe
he doesn’t know the road.”</p>

<p>“Look out for that turn!” cried Jerry, as the
man passed them.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if he heard them. Certainly he
did not heed, for he swung around the turn at full
speed. A moment later the boys, who had drawn
to one side of the road, in order to give the man
plenty of room to pass, looked back.</p>

<p>They saw the speeding roadster leave the highway
and plunge down the bank, turning over and
pinning the driver underneath.</p>

<p>“There he goes!” cried Jerry, jamming on the
brakes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>A FAMILY CONFERENCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry had put on the brakes so hard that the
rear wheels were locked, and they slid along a
foot or more, skidding until the automobile came to
a stop on one side of the road. Then the three lads
leaped out, and started back toward the scene of
the accident.</p>

<p>“She’s on fire!” cried Bob, as he pointed to
curling smoke arising from the overturned roadster.</p>

<p>“And the man’s under it!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“Keep moving!” shouted Jerry. “We’ve got
to do something!”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the car was a light one, and it was
tilted at such an angle that the combined strength
of the three lads on the higher side served to turn
it upright once more. The fire was under the
bonnet, the covers of which were jammed and
bent.</p>

<p>The boys had expected to find a very seriously
injured man beneath the car, but, to their surprise,
when they righted the machine, the driver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
somewhat dusty and dirty, crawled out and stood
up, a few scratches on his hands and face alone
showing where he was injured, though it was evident
from the manner in which he rubbed one arm
that it had been at least bruised.</p>

<p>There came a larger puff of smoke from beneath
the car’s bonnet, and a flash of flame
showed.</p>

<p>“Carburetor’s on fire!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Got an extinguisher?” asked Jerry of the
man.</p>

<p>He shook his head, being either too much out
of breath or too excited over his narrow escape
to talk.</p>

<p>“I’ll get ours!” shouted Ned, as he raced back
toward their machine, climbing up the bank, down
which the boys had rushed to the rescue.</p>

<p>Jerry and Bob forced up the bent and jammed
covers of the engine, and disclosed the fact that
the fire, so far, was only in the carburetor, which
had become flooded with gasoline when the car
turned over.</p>

<p>In a few seconds Ned was back with the extinguisher,
and when a generous supply of the
chemicals it contained had been squirted on the
blazing gasoline, the fire went out with a smudge
of smoke.</p>

<p>“That was a narrow escape for me, boys,” said
the man, and his voice shook a little. “I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sure I was done for when I felt the car leaving
the road. I tried to bring it back, but the turn
was too much for me, and over I went.”</p>

<p>“This is a dangerous turn,” commented Jerry.
“There ought to be a warning sign put up here.”</p>

<p>“We called to you,” Bob told him.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear you,” the man said. “Boys, I
want to thank you!”</p>

<p>He seemed overcome for a moment. Then he
went on.</p>

<p>“Mere thanks, of course, do not express what
I mean. You saved my life. I don’t believe I
could have gotten out of the car alone. My legs
were held down, and so was one arm. I’d have
burned to death if you hadn’t been here.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re glad we were here,” Jerry said.
“Are you much hurt?”</p>

<p>“Nothing worth speaking about. Some bruises
and scratches. I certainly did have a lucky escape.
My name is Hobson—Samuel Hobson,”
and he drew a card from his pocket, handing it
to Jerry. “I was driving a bit too fast, I guess,
but I was in a hurry to get the express at Wrightville.
I’m on my way West, on important business,
and the only way to make connections is to
go to Wrightville to get the fast train. So I
started in my car, intending to leave it at the
garage in Wrightville. I’m afraid I’ll miss the
train now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you’ve got time to make it,” said
Jerry, with a look at his watch. “Wrightville is
only three miles from here. But I’m afraid you
can’t make it in your car.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve said it,” admitted Mr. Hobson,
after a quick inspection. “I can’t run my car until
it’s been in the repair shop. It’ll be hard to get
it back on the road, too,” he went on, as he looked
at the steep bank down which he had rolled in the
machine. “And I <em>must</em> get that train!” he exclaimed
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can get you to the train all right
in our car,” said Bob. “We’re not in any special
hurry—only out for a little ride. We’ll take you
to the station.”</p>

<p>“Surely!” added Jerry. “If you feel well
enough to take the ride.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m all right!” protested Mr. Hobson.
“I had presence of mind enough to get out of
the way of the steering wheel as I felt myself
going over. I’ll be very much obliged if you will
take me to the depot. It is extremely important
that I get my train for the West. But about my
car—I’ll have to leave it here, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Nobody can run it, that’s sure,” Ned remarked.
“And if you were going to leave it at
the garage in Wrightville you could tell the man
there to come out here and get it, and tow it in
for repairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so, I could do that,” admitted Mr.
Hobson. “I don’t know that I’ll have time, if I
make my train, to tell the garage people, though.”</p>

<p>“We can do that for you,” offered Jerry.
“We’ll tell the garage man after we leave you at
the depot.”</p>

<p>“Will you, boys? I’ll be a thousand times
obliged to you if you will! I wouldn’t miss that
train for a good deal. Just tell the garage man
to come and get my car. I’ll settle all expenses
with him when I come back, which will be in a
couple of weeks.</p>

<p>“And now, if you don’t mind, I’ll get in your
car and let you take me to Wrightville. It’s very
kind of you. I thought I was in for a streak of
bad luck when my machine went over with me,
but this seems to be a turn for the better.”</p>

<p>Leaving the wrecked car where it was, Jerry
and his chums went back to their machine with
Mr. Hobson, giving their names on the way. It
was a short run to Wrightville, but Mr. Hobson,
who did not have any too much time to begin with,
only just made the train as it was.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, boys!” he called, as he swung
aboard the express, waving his hand to them.
“See you again some time, I hope.”</p>

<p>And it was under rather strange circumstances
when Mr. Hobson once more confronted our
heroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, now to tell the garage man, and then
for the eats!” exclaimed Bob as they rode away
from the railroad station. “I’ve got more of
an appetite than ever. That little excitement
seemed to make me hungry.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t take much to make <em>you</em> hungry,”
commented Jerry. “But we might as well eat
here as to go on to Wallace’s. That would take
half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s eat here,” acquiesced Chunky, and
Ned assenting, that plan was agreed upon.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hobson? Oh, yes, I know him,” the
garage man said when the story of the wrecked
car had been told. “He often passes through
here. Just leave it to me. I’ll go out and get
his machine, tow it in and fix it up. I know the
place all right. That sure is a bad turn. I guess
he never had been on that road before. But I’ll
get his car right away.”</p>

<p>“Then we can eat,” said Bob, with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>While the three boys were making for a restaurant,
there was taking place back in Jerry’s home
the family conference, the knowledge of which
had, in a measure, rather disturbed the three
chums. For though they knew that it was going
on, they could only guess at the object, which
seemed to be rather important.</p>

<p>And, in a sense, it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>That morning Mr. Aaron Slade, the head of
the largest department store in Cresville, a town
not far from Boston, had called on Mr. Andrew
Baker, the banker.</p>

<p>“Andrew,” Mr. Slade had said (for he and
the banker were old friends), “what are we going
to do with our boys?”</p>

<p>“That’s just the question which has been puzzling
me,” said Mr. Baker.</p>

<p>“They are the finest fellows in the world,” went
on Mr. Slade, “and so is their chum, Jerry Hopkins.
But, to tell you the truth, Andrew, I’m a
bit worried about Ned.”</p>

<p>“And I am about Bob. Not that he’s done
anything wrong, but he is getting too wild. I’m
afraid they’ve been allowed too much freedom,
what with their auto, their motor boat, and airship.
I thought, at the time, it was good for them
to go off by themselves, and learn to depend on
their own efforts, as they certainly did many times.
But now I’m beginning to think differently.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” admitted his friend. “Take that
little incident last week—I was telling you about
it, I guess—how they raced with some fellow on
the road, and nearly collided with a hay wagon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about it. Well, boys will be
boys, I suppose, but I’ve made up my mind that
mine will have to settle down a little more.”</p>

<p>“The same here. But how can we do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment the two business men remained
in thought. Then Mr. Slade said:</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’d better do, Andrew.
Let’s go and have a talk with Mrs. Hopkins.
She’s one of the most capable, efficient and level-headed
women I know. That’s one reason why
I sold her some stock in my store. Her son Jerry
is such a chum of our boys that I’ve no doubt she
feels about as we do, for Jerry is into the same
scrapes and fun that our boys get into. Let’s
go and have a talk with Mrs. Hopkins.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” the banker exclaimed. “I’ll
call her on the ’phone and see if it’s convenient
for us to run out there.”</p>

<p>A few moments’ talk over the wire apprised
Mrs. Hopkins of what was in the air, and she invited
the two gentlemen to call.</p>

<p>That is the reason Mrs. Hopkins did not go
motoring with Jerry. So Jerry took his two
chums, who were made aware of the family conference
in that fashion.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen,” said Mrs. Hopkins, when
the matter had been fully explained to her, and
Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker had each expressed
the idea that their sons were in need of a little
taming down, “I feel about it as you do. I wish
Jerry were not quite so lively and fond of such
exciting adventures. But now we have arrived at
that decision, what’s to be done?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“The very question I asked!” exclaimed Mr.
Slade.</p>

<p>“Send ’em to college!” proposed Mr. Baker,
after a moment’s thought. “A good, strict, up-to-date
college is the place for them. They’d have
to buckle down to hard work, but there would be
enough of athletic sport to give them an outlet
for their energies. Send the boys to college!
How does that idea strike you?”</p>

<p>“It might be the very thing,” answered Mrs.
Hopkins thoughtfully. “The boys have a pretty
good education as it is from the Academy and
from their private studies, but of late they have
been allowed to run a little too freely. I should
say college would be the best thing in the world
for them. Some difficult studies would give their
too active brains something more than adventures
to feed on, and I have faith enough in the boys
to be sure they would strive to do well—to excel
in their studies as they have excelled in quests,
races and other things in which they have taken
part.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you agree with me,” said Mr.
Baker. “How about you, Aaron?” and he looked
across at Ned’s father.</p>

<p>“I’m of the same opinion,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Baker. “Well, now
that is settled, which college shall it be? There
are several good ones in this section of New England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
but the question is whether they are just
those best fitted for our boys.”</p>

<p>“How about a military academy?” asked Mr.
Slade. “They’d get good discipline there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins shook her head.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a word to say against militarism, except
that I think war a terrible thing,” she said.
“I believe in preparedness, too, but I don’t fancy
a military school for Jerry. I’m afraid there
would be a little too much discipline at first, when
the boys have been used to so little.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” said Mr. Slade. “I
am not very much in favor of it myself.”</p>

<p>Several colleges were mentioned at the family
conference, but nothing definite was decided on,
and it was agreed to meet again in a day or so.
Meanwhile the catalogues of several institutions
could be sent for to judge which college would be
best suited to the boys.</p>

<p>“A very capable woman,” commented Mr.
Slade, as he and his friend left Mrs. Hopkins’s
house.</p>

<p>“Very. And I am glad we have come to this
decision about our boys.”</p>

<p>“So am I. I wonder how the boys will take
it.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to tell. We won’t say anything to
them about it for a while.”</p>

<p>“No,” agreed Mr. Slade.</p>

</div>


<p>“Well, I feel better,” announced Bob Baker,
with a satisfied sigh as he arose from the restaurant
table.</p>

<p>“I should think you would!” commented Jerry.
“You ate as much as the two of us,” and he
nodded at Ned.</p>

<p>“I did not!” cried the indignant Chunky. “I’ll
leave it to the waiter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t call public attention to a thing like
that,” put in Ned. “Let it go. Come on out and
finish our ride. It’s too nice to be staying inside,
even in a restaurant.”</p>

<p>It was a beautiful fall day. The fierceness of
the summer heat had gone, but the tang of late
fall had not yet come, and it was perfect weather
for automobile riding.</p>

<p>Jerry and his chums were soon in the car once
more, this time Ned taking the wheel. They
drove out past the place where Mr. Hobson had
met with his accident—an accident with a most
fortunate outcome—and there the boys saw some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
men from the garage engaged in pulling the disabled
car up the bank.</p>

<p>“That was some tumble!” called one of the
men, as the boys paused to look on.</p>

<p>“You’d have thought so if you’d seen it,”
agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>It was just getting dusk when the three lads
reached Jerry’s home.</p>

<p>“I’ll drive you chaps home, and put up the
car,” he said, for the automobile, though owned
jointly by the lads, was kept in a garage owned
by Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do to-night?” asked
Ned, as he was set down at his residence.</p>

<p>“Nothing special,” Jerry replied.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the movies,” suggested Bob.
“They’ve got some Southern travel scenes, according
to the bills outside, and if we go down South
this winter we may see some of the places where
we expect to be thrown on the screen.”</p>

<p>“I’d just as soon,” agreed Jerry, and Ned
nodded his assent.</p>

<p>“I’ll come over to your house, Ned, after supper,”
Bob went on, “and Jerry can call there for
us.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jerry assented, and then he swung
the car in the direction of his home.</p>

<p>“Did you have a nice ride?” his mother asked
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fine!” he exclaimed. “Saved a man’s life,
too!”</p>

<p>“More adventures!” Mrs. Hopkins exclaimed,
thinking of the conference that afternoon.</p>

<p>“No, it was the other way around,” Jerry explained.
“Mr. Hobson had the adventure, we
just rescued him from it,” and he told of the overturned
automobile.</p>

<p>“Such reckless driving!” his mother murmured.
“I hope you boys don’t run your car so fast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” exclaimed Jerry virtuously. “I wonder
if she could have meant anything by that?”
he asked himself as his mother went out of the
room. “But I don’t believe she heard about that
hay wagon. I hope not, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Jerry! there’s a letter for you on the mantel,”
his mother called back to him as she went upstairs.</p>

<p>“Wonder who it’s from,” mused the tall lad.
It was in a long envelope, without any return
designation, and Jerry’s name and address were
typewritten, so he could not guess the sender, as
he might have done had it been in script.</p>

<p>“Some advertisement,” the lad went on, somewhat
disappointed, as he drew out a booklet.
With it was a letter, and when Jerry had glanced
at the signature, before reading the epistle, he
cried in delight.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s from Professor Snodgrass! What
in the world is he up to now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Readers of the former books of this series concerning
Ned, Bob and Jerry (volumes which will
be mentioned more at length later) will remember
Professor Uriah Snodgrass, a most earnest scientist.
His quest after rare bugs and queer animals
furnished our heroes with more than one adventure,
and took them into various queer places.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” went on Jerry. “I
haven’t heard from him in a long while. I wonder
where he is now?”</p>

<p>A glance at the top of the letter showed him.</p>

<p>The epistle was dated from Fordham, a New
England city, and at the top of the page, in embossed
letters, was the name “Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dear Jerry,” the letter read, “no doubt you
will be surprised to hear that I have been appointed
instructor of zoology, among other subjects,
at Boxwood Hall.”</p></div>

<p>“Surprised is no name for it!” murmured Jerry,
reading on.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For some time the faculty has been trying to
induce me to settle down here, but I have preferred
to roam about, completing my collection
of beetles. As that is about finished, I have decided
to accept the chair here. It is an excellent
college, and there are a number of fine students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
here, but I shall miss the trips I used to take with
you boys. Perhaps, though, during the vacations,
I may be able to be with you for a time. I am
making a collection of butterflies that are to be
found in this section of New England. I have a
number of fine specimens mounted, but as winter
is approaching there will be little further chance
to add to my collection until the spring.</p>

<p>“I am sending you one of the Boxwood Hall
catalogues, thinking you may be interested in
it. If you are ever in this neighborhood, please
come to see me. I am sure you will like it here.
I understand there are good football and baseball
teams here, and if you get here this fall,
on one of the many trips you take, you may
see a good game. I don’t know much about
such things myself. Please give my regards to
your mother, and remember me to Ned and
Bob.”</p></div>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that!” exclaimed
Jerry. “Professor Snodgrass at Boxwood
Hall! I’ve heard of that college, and it’s a good
one. Well, I guess he’ll miss chasing around the
country after bugs, but the college certainly has
one good instructor! I must tell the boys.”</p>

<p>“Any news in your letter, Jerry?” asked Mrs.
Hopkins at the supper table that evening.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass has taken the chair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
zoology at Boxwood Hall,” he replied. And then
Mrs. Hopkins was called to the telephone, so
Jerry had no chance to mention the catalogue he
had received.</p>

<p>A little later he went with his chums to the
moving picture show, telling them the news of
the professor. At Ned’s house, after the show,
the boys looked at the catalogue, which contained
many half-tone cuts of the college buildings and
grounds.</p>

<p>“Seems to be a nice place all right,” commented
Bob.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“It’s about a mile outside of Fordham,” said
Jerry, who had glanced through the prospectus.
“I didn’t know, before, what a large place Boxwood
Hall was. See, it’s located right on Lake
Carmona, and they have a boathouse on the college
grounds. Lake Carmona is one of the prettiest
in New England, they say, though I’ve never
seen it.”</p>

<p>“I was at the upper end of it once,” Ned stated,
“but I didn’t get near Boxwood. And so the dear
old professor has settled down. Well, we sure
did have good times with him!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Jerry. “Maybe we’ll
get a chance to run up and see him.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” remarked Bob. “Look! Here’s
the professor’s name in the list of the faculty,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and he pointed it out in the catalogue. “He’s
got half the letters of the alphabet after it, too.”</p>

<p>This was not strictly true, though Professor
Snodgrass had received many degrees from prominent
colleges for his scientific work. He had
written several books, too, on various subjects
connected with “bugology,” as the boys called it.</p>

<p>After some discussion of the new position
which had been accepted by their friend, the professor,
and some reminiscent talk of the times
they had spent with him, Jerry and Bob went
to their respective homes, agreeing to go for another
automobile ride on the morrow.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do now?” asked Jerry
of his chums one afternoon, several days after
the receipt of the letter from Professor Snodgrass.
“I don’t just fancy any more autoing for the present.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with a ride in the motor
boat?” asked Bob, for the boys owned one. It
was kept in the boathouse near the residence of
Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Suits me,” agreed Ned, while Bob began:</p>

<p>“We can drop down the river to Anderson’s
place and——”</p>

<p>“Get something to eat,” cut in Jerry.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so!” Bob cried.</p>

<p>“No, but you thought it all right. Come on.”</p>

<p>The boys started for Jerry’s home, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
foot of the long, green lawn that led up to the
front porch Ned cried:</p>

<p>“I’ll race you to the front steps to see who
pays for the ice cream sodas. Last man there
pays!”</p>

<p>“All right!” assented Jerry.</p>

<p>“Give me a start,” begged Bob.</p>

<p>“Go on!” yelled Jerry. “You’re not so fat
as all that. We start even.”</p>

<p>“I’m entitled to a handicap,” insisted Bob.</p>

<p>The boys were laughing and shouting, and making
considerable noise.</p>

<p>Bob insisted that he would not race unless he
was given the advantage he claimed because of
his stoutness, and finally Ned and Jerry agreed,
letting Bob have his “head start.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“Go!” cried Bob, and the three lads raced toward
the piazza.</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry cut down Bob’s lead in a short
time, and Jerry, by reason of slightly longer legs,
soon passed Ned. They all three approached the
porch, Jerry and Bob reaching it at the same
moment. They were both going so fast they
could not stop, and a moment later Bob tripped
and would have fallen had he not given a jump
up in the air, and landed on the porch. Then he
slipped, and fell with a bang, spinning along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
piazza floor, while Jerry and Ned, laughing and
shouting, jumped up after him. Then, seizing
him, one by each foot, <a href="#image02">they pulled him the length
of the smooth porch</a>, which had no railing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_28">THEY PULLED BOB THE LENGTH OF THE SMOOTH PORCH.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Whoop! That was some race!” yelled Ned.</p>

<p>“And I beat!” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“Go on! You did not! You were disqualified
by falling!” declared Jerry. “I’m the champion!”
and he executed a clog dance on the veranda.</p>

<p>At that moment the front door opened, and
there stood Mrs. Hopkins, while behind her were
Mr. Slade and Mr. Baker. Mrs. Hopkins did
not smile, and there were rather serious expressions
on the faces of the two gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Oh, was it you making all the noise, Jerry?”
his mother asked.</p>

<p>“I guess we did our share,” admitted Ned, a
little sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Come in, boys,” said Mr. Baker. “We have
an announcement to make to you.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE DECISION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Looks as if something was up,” whispered
Bob to Ned, as the three chums slid into the house.</p>

<p>“That’s what it does,” agreed Ned. “I guess
Mrs. Hopkins thought we were making too much
of a racket on her front stoop.”</p>

<p>“We did raise a sort of row,” commented
Jerry, tossing his hat on a peg of the rack. “But
mother doesn’t care an awful lot about that.
She’s heard noise before. There’s something else
in the wind, believe me!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hopkins, with the fathers of Bob and
Ned, had withdrawn from the hall into the library,
where they could be heard in low-voiced conversation.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the game is,” came from Ned.
“Another family conference! Did you know they
were going to have it, Jerry?”</p>

<p>The tall lad shook his head.</p>

<p>“Unless it’s about us I can’t imagine what it’s
for,” he said. “But I reckon it does concern us.
Well, we’ll have to take our medicine, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come in, boys,” called Mrs. Hopkins. “What
we have to say concerns you as much as it does
us.”</p>

<p>Rather sheepishly Ned, Bob and Jerry filed into
the library, and took seats. Mrs. Hopkins was
seated at a table with her two guests, and on this
there appeared to be a pile of books, over which
a newspaper was thrown, as though to conceal
them from view, temporarily at least.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you young men might be a little
more quiet in approaching a lady’s house,” remarked
Mr. Slade, looking at his son; and his
voice was not as good-natured as usual.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Dad,” came the response, “you see
we just had a little race, to decide who’d buy the
ice cream sodas, and we did make rather a strenuous
finish of it, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Mr. Baker, looking
at his son. “I thought it was a mad-dog chase
at least, banging up on the steps that way. But it
only goes to show that it’s high time we took some
action in your cases.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” put in Mr. Slade, with a vigorous
nod.</p>

<p>The three chums looked wonderingly at one another.</p>

<p>“Surely they can’t be going to punish us just
for a little prank like that,” thought Jerry. His
mother looked at him and smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mind a little noise,” she said.
“But I really think it is time something was done
to subdue the lads a little. They are getting a
bit too much out of hand.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t acted a bit too soon,” murmured
Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“I only hope it isn’t too late,” added the banker.</p>

<p>Once more the chums looked wonderingly at
one another, and then Ned, addressing his father,
burst out with:</p>

<p>“Say, Dad, what’s it all about, anyhow?
What’s up? Are we on trial just because we
made a racket over a foot race?”</p>

<p>“We’ll apologize to Mrs. Hopkins, if you want
us to,” Bob said.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, my dear boy, no apology is required!”
Jerry’s mother made haste to say. “While you
did make considerable noise, that isn’t the reason
we called you in to hear our decision about a certain
matter. Of course the way you all acted just
now bears out what we have been fearful of for
some time back, and that is—perhaps one of you
gentlemen can explain better than I,” she finished
with a nod toward Mr. Baker and Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>There was a momentary hesitation on the part
of each of them, while the looks of wonder, not
unmixed with apprehension, deepened on the faces
of the chums. Then Mr. Slade said:</p>

<p>“Well, boys, it amounts to this. For some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
we have been noticing your conduct. Not that
you have done anything wrong or improper, but
you haven’t done exactly what is right, either.
You are getting on in years, in fact you are young
men now, and boys no longer, so it is time you
acted like young men.”</p>

<p>“If that race just now——” broke in Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t altogether that!” his father made
haste to say. “That is only one straw that shows
which way the wind is blowing. You are entirely
too frivolous, and when I say that I include you,
Jerry, and you, Bob, with the permission of your
parents.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I agreed with Mr. Slade,” murmured
Mrs. Hopkins.</p>

<p>“And I,” added the banker.</p>

<p>“So we have called you in to acquaint you with
our decision,” the department store proprietor
went on. “And I want to say that we did not arrive
at it hastily. We have had several conferences
on the matter, as we wanted to be fair and
just to all of you, and we wanted to do our duty.
Now perhaps you have something to say, Mr.
Baker, before we tell the boys what is in store for
them.”</p>

<p>“Looks serious,” Jerry formed the words with
his lips to Ned, but did not emit a whisper.</p>

<p>Ned nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>“Well, Aaron, you’ve said about all there is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
say on the subject,” began the banker slowly. “I
might add that I think our boys have had plenty
of good times and strenuous adventures. There
can be no complaint on their part about that. And,
boys, I want to say that you must now settle down
and prepare to make real men of yourselves. You
are boys no longer—you must prepare to accept
the responsibilities of life. Have you anything
to add, Mrs. Hopkins?”</p>

<p>“Nothing except that I fully agree with you
gentlemen. And I think what we are about to do
will be for the best interests of all of us, especially
of our boys. We are proud of them in spite of
the fact that they are sometimes a little too careless,
and we want to continue to be proud of you,
boys. Tell them what we have decided to do,
Mr. Slade.”</p>

<p>“It is this,” said the department store keeper,
as he removed the newspaper from the pile of
books, or rather, pamphlets. “We are going to
send you boys to some college or military academy,
where, under stricter discipline than any to
which you have hitherto been subjected, you will
be able to develop your characters.”</p>

<p>“Sent away to college!” exclaimed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Military academy!” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>“Strict discipline!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Mr.
Baker went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the conclusion we have arrived at
after giving the matter serious thought. It will
be the best thing in the world for you young men—boys
no longer—to go away to some college.
You will have regular hours and regular studies,
which you have not had in the past two years.
Not that you are backward, for you have kept
yourselves well informed, and your travels have
been helpful, in a measure. But you need regularity,
and you are going to get it.</p>

<p>“Now we have here,” he went on, “catalogues
from several institutions of learning. They are
all good, as far as we can tell, and any one of them
would suit me as a place for my boy. We have not
quite made up our minds which one to choose.
We want you all to go to the same one.”</p>

<p>“I should say, yes!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to be impertinent,” added Ned,
“but we couldn’t think of going to separate colleges.
We must be together.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we are very glad we can give in to you
on that point,” said Mr. Slade, smiling.</p>

<p>“Now we will proceed to the further discussion,
which you interrupted with your strenuous foot
race,” said Mr. Baker, “and we will let you help
us decide which college you will attend. Now here
is a catalogue that interests me,” and he held up
one of a well-known college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>There was quite a lengthy discussion, in which
the boys joined, telling what they knew, or had
heard, of certain institutions. Some they flatly
refused to consider at all. Toward others they
were more favorably inclined.</p>

<p>“Now here is one I should like to see you attend,”
said Mr. Slade, holding up another prospectus.
“It is——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by an exclamation from
Jerry, who rushed from the room.</p>

<p>“Why! what in the world is the matter with
him?” asked Mrs. Hopkins in surprise.</p>

<p>No one answered, and before they could indulge
in any speculation Jerry was back again,
waving over his head a catalogue similar to those
on the table.</p>

<p>“If we have to go to college,” he said, “and
I guess we do, this is the one we’d like you to pick
out—Boxwood Hall! Let us go there! It’s a
dandy place, according to the catalogue, and it has
a good standing from a scholastic and athletic
standpoint. Let us go to Boxwood Hall, where
our old friend, Professor Snodgrass, is a teacher.”</p>

<p>“Boxwood Hall?” murmured Mr. Slade, questioningly.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass,” said Mr. Baker, reflectively.</p>

<p>“He sent me this catalogue,” Jerry went on,
“though when I got it I hadn’t the least notion in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the world that I would go there. Let me read
you the professor’s letter”; and this he did.</p>

<p>Mr. Slade picked up the Boxwood Hall catalogue
and glanced at the illustrations of the various
buildings.</p>

<p>“It looks like a nice place,” he said.</p>

<p>“It sure does!” exclaimed his son, looking over
his father’s shoulder. “We would like it there.”</p>

<p>“And there are some well known names on the
faculty, aside from that of Professor Snodgrass,”
went on Mr. Slade.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass,” murmured Mr. Baker.
“He’s the scientist who so often went with you
boys on your trips, gathering queer bugs and so
on.”</p>

<p>“He’s the one!” Jerry remarked. “Say, fellows,
will you ever forget the time he saw a bug
on the railroad track, and almost got under the
locomotive to capture the insect.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chorused Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s the one objection to Boxwood Hall,”
resumed Mr. Baker. “I’m afraid instead of studying,
you boys will be going off on bug-hunting trips
with Professor Snodgrass. I guess we’d better
decide on some other college.”</p>

<small>GOOD NEWS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Blank looks replaced those of pleasant anticipation
on the faces of Ned, Bob and Jerry. Slowly
they glanced at one another, then Ned burst out
with:</p>

<p>“Say, Dad, that’s all wrong! Don’t be so hard
on us. If we have to go to college the best one
in the world for us will be Boxwood Hall, because
we’ll have such a good friend in Professor
Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“And we won’t go off bug hunting with him—at
least not very often,” said Jerry. “We won’t
have time, nor will he. And you can see by his
letter that he’s done with bugs. He’s making a
collection of butterflies now.”</p>

<p>“That’s just as bad,” said Mrs. Hopkins, with
a smile at her son. “Butterflies will lead you farther
afield.”</p>

<p>“There won’t be many more butterflies this
year,” Ned remarked. “Though I suppose there
may be a few late ones up around Fordham that
the professor will bag in his net. But, really, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
won’t waste any time on them. Let us go to Boxwood
Hall, and we’ll buckle down to hard study.”</p>

<p>“We can go in for athletics though; can’t we?”
asked Bob. “They have a swell football eleven
and a dandy baseball nine at Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we haven’t any objections to sports, if
you don’t go in for them too heavily,” said Mr.
Baker. “What do you say?” and he glanced at
the department store proprietor and at Mrs. Hopkins.
“Shall we let the boys have their way?”</p>

<p>“Let’s consider it farther,” suggested Mr.
Slade. “We’ll write to—let me see—Dr. Anderson
Cole is the college president,” he went on, referring
to the catalogue. “We’ll write to him and
see what sort of arrangements can be made.”</p>

<p>“We could start in with the fall term,” observed
Jerry. “Boxwood doesn’t open as early
as some of the other colleges.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about it,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll write the letters,” offered the banker. “My
stenographer isn’t overworked, and I will get her
at them the first thing in the morning. And I
guess that ends the conference, for the time being,”
he concluded.</p>

<p>“Then may we go?” asked his son. “We are
going out in the motor boat.”</p>

<p>“Yes, run along,” said Mrs. Hopkins. “Jerry,
let Mr. Baker have the catalogue the professor
sent. He’ll need to refer to it for his letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later the three chums were hastening
toward the house where their motor boat was
kept.</p>

<p>“Say! won’t it be great if we can go to Boxwood?”
exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“The finest thing ever!” declared Jerry. “It
will do us good to see the professor again.”</p>

<p>“So that’s what all this confabbing business on
the part of our respected parents was about,”
commented Ned. “I hadn’t any idea it would
turn out this way.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” admitted Jerry. “I thought something
was in the wind along the line of making
us settle down, but I was afraid mother might be
going to make me go to work. Not that I would
mind work,” he made haste to add, “but I’m not
quite ready for it.”</p>

<p>“I thought maybe they were going to take the
car, the boat and the airship away from us,” observed
Bob, for our heroes, as their friends who
have read about them in previous books know, did
have a fine airship, in which they had gone through
many adventures.</p>

<p>“That would be a hardship,” said Jerry. “But
going to college isn’t half bad. I’m glad they decided
on it. I guess a little discipline and settling
down will be good for all of us. It’s a lucky
thing Professor Snodgrass sent me that catalogue.
If I hadn’t had that to spring on ’em they might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
have packed us off to some place where we
wouldn’t have a friend to our names.”</p>

<p>“They may yet,” suggested Bob half gloomily.
“They may decide against Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” remarked Jerry. “I sort
of think they’re favorably disposed toward it, for
it is a first-class place. And say! why, we can
take our motor boat there!” he cried. “There’s
Lake Carmona—a dandy place for a boat.”</p>

<p>“But it will soon be winter,” objected Ned,
“and the lake will freeze over.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” declared Jerry. “It will be
some time before freezing weather sets in, and
there’ll be lots of time to take trips on the lake.
We’ll have to store the boat over winter, of
course, but she’ll be there in the spring. We’ll
take the <i>Neboje</i> with us.”</p>

<p>The <i>Neboje</i> (the name being made up of the
first two letters of Ned, Bob and Jerry) was a
new craft. It was smaller than the last boat the
boys had bought, and they often preferred it, as
it was easier to handle. It was so arranged that
they could sleep and cook on board, and make
short cruises on lake or river.</p>

<p>“Sure, take the boat!” exclaimed Bob. “And
why can’t we take the auto too?”</p>

<p>“We could, I guess,” conceded Jerry. “The
only thing is, though, that the fellows at Boxwood
may think we’re putting it on rather thick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess not,” said Ned. “If we took our airship
they might. But some of them are sure to
have cars themselves, and with the lake so near it
would be a wonder if there wasn’t one or two
motor boats owned by the students. We’ll take
her along.”</p>

<p>“That is, if we go,” observed Jerry with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll go!” declared Bob, as they reached
the boathouse.</p>

<p>“Got enough gasoline?” asked Jerry, as he took
the tarpaulin cover off the <i>Neboje</i>.</p>

<p>“Plenty,” announced Bob, looking at the gauge.
“We’ll only go for a little run, as I want to get
back in time for——”</p>

<p>“Grub!” broke in Ned with a laugh, and then
he had to dodge the bailing sponge which the
stout youth threw at his head.</p>

<p>Ned caught the sponge and threw it back at
Bob, but with such poor aim that it struck Jerry
in the face, and, being wet, it was not the most
desirable object in the world to receive in that
fashion.</p>

<p>“Here! What are you doing?” roared Jerry,
wiping his dripping face. “I’ve had my bath this
week. Cut out the rough stuff!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” came from Ned. “It was
Bob’s fault.”</p>

<p>“It was not! You threw it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You chucked it first.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t have if you hadn’t ragged
me about my eating. And I wasn’t going to say
anything about grub, either. I meant I wanted
to get home early so I could talk more to dad
about Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“Go on! You’re going to see a girl!” scoffed
Jerry.</p>

<p>Bob flared up again, but quiet was finally restored
and, the boathouse doors having been
thrown open, Ned pressed the button of the self-starter
and the <i>Neboje</i> swung out into the river
which ran near the Hopkins’ house.</p>

<p>As the chums, comfortably seated in their craft,
were getting under way, they heard a hail.</p>

<p>“Hold on, boys—wait a minute—got something
to tell you—don’t go away without me—it’s
great news—come on back—slow down—turn
off the gasoline—shut off the spark—swing her
around—whoop!”</p>

<p>“No need to look to tell who that is,” Jerry
remarked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s Andy Rush,” said Bob, as he glanced
at a small and very much excited boy who was
dancing about on the dock.</p>

<p>“Come back and get me!” he begged.</p>

<p>“Shall we?” asked Ned, who was steering.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I guess so,” assented Jerry. “Andy’s
all right if he does talk like a gasoline motor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wonder what news he has,” ventured Bob.</p>

<p>Ned swung the boat about, and Andy, whom
my older readers will remember, got aboard.
He was panting from his rapid-fire talk.</p>

<p>“What’s the news?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s about Noddy Nixon,” said Andy Rush,
when he had gotten back his breath.</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t good news,” averred Jerry, for
in the past Noddy had made much trouble for
the three chums.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t good news,” said Andy. “He’s
hurt somewhere out West. He ran his automobile
into another one, and now he’s in a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wish Noddy any bad luck, for all
he did us several mean turns,” remarked Jerry.
“But he never did know how to handle a car—he
was too reckless. Is he badly hurt, Andy?”</p>

<p>“Well, he won’t die, but it will be a good while
before he’ll be well. A friend of my mother’s,
who lives out West, wrote her about Noddy,
knowing he used to live here.”</p>

<p>“I hope he never comes back here to live,” Ned
remarked. “We can easily get along without
him.”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us!” chimed in Bob.</p>

<p>The boys enjoyed the little motor boat trip,
though Andy Rush, as usual, talked so much and
so fast that Jerry said he gave him a headache.</p>

<p>“Here, earn your passage,” the tall youth finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cried. “Polish some of the brass rail. That
will give you a safety-valve,” and Andy, perforce,
had to obey.</p>

<p>It was several days after this that Bob Baker
came hurrying over to the Hopkins house.</p>

<p>“Good news!” cried the stout youth.</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Dad has had a letter from President Cole, of
Boxwood Hall, and everything is so satisfactory
that dad has decided I am to go there. Hurrah!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah yourself!” retorted Jerry. “What
about Ned and me?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. I just left Ned, and his father
says if Mr. Baker is satisfied he’ll be, so Ned can
go. It rests with your mother whether you can,
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure mother will say yes! I’ll tell
her! Say! this is great—all three of us to go to
Boxwood Hall! Wow!” and Jerry did a clog
dance that brought his mother to the door of her
room to learn the cause of the excitement.</p>

<p>She readily gave her consent to the Boxwood
Hall project for Jerry, and later that day there
was another conference of the parents. There had
been considerable correspondence between Mr.
Baker and President Cole, and the banker was
more than satisfied with the showing made by the
college.</p>

<p>“I think it will be just the place for the boys,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
he declared, “and I will write to President Cole,
informing him they will be on hand soon after,
if not at, the opening of the fall term. We shall
have to get them ready, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“That won’t take long,” Jerry said. “Now I’ll
write to Professor Snodgrass, and tell him we’ll
soon be with him.”</p>

<p>Thus the matter was decided. The names of
Ned, Bob and Jerry were formally entered for
admission to Boxwood Hall, and their standing
in their studies was such that they had to take
but few examinations.</p>

<p>In the letter to Professor Snodgrass Jerry explained
how it had all come about, and he thanked
the little scientist for having sent the catalogue.</p>

<p>“Only for that,” Jerry wrote, “we might have
been packed off to some place where we wouldn’t
have liked it at all. I’m afraid we won’t get a
chance to go hunting butterflies with you, much as
we would like it.”</p>

<p>In reply Jerry had another letter from the bug-collector.
Professor Snodgrass wrote that there
would be plenty of chance for him to have outings
with the boys.</p>

<p>“That’s fine!” cried Jerry. “Hurrah for Boxwood
Hall!”</p>

<p>And his chums echoed the exultant cry.</p>

<small>BOXWOOD HALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Imagine a great, green, grassy bowl, nestled
snugly amid a succession of green hills, set, more
or less regularly, in a circle. And at the bottom
of the great, green, grassy bowl, which is miles
across, imagine further a silvery sheet, irregular
in outline and sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p>Up on one of the sides of the green, grassy
bowl, where it leveled out into a sort of plateau,
is a group of dull, red buildings, their maroon
color contrasting pleasingly with the emerald tint
of the surroundings. Across the tip of another
hill lay a country town, and from a vantage point
one could see a railroad, like a shiny snake, winding
its way up to the town, stopping there, in the
shape of a station, and then going on across the
valley.</p>

<p>The town is that of Fordham—a city some
called it. It was in New England, about half way
between Boston and New York. The green bowl
was Fordham valley, and the shining, glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
bottom of it was Lake Carmona, a beautiful sheet
of water, some miles in extent.</p>

<p>The group of red buildings was Boxwood Hall
with which we shall soon concern ourselves, and
which was very much in the minds of Ned, Bob
and Jerry at this moment, as it had been for some
time. The college buildings were about a mile, or,
say a mile and a half to be exact, from the Fordham
railroad station, and were practically on the
shore of Lake Carmona, for the college owned the
land running down to the lake, and had on it a
boathouse and a dock. But the buildings themselves
lay back a quarter of a mile from the water,
and this quarter of a mile, somewhat less in width,
formed the college campus—one not surpassed
anywhere.</p>

<p>Upon this campus, strolling about here and
there this fine fall day, was a group of lads attired
in the more or less exaggerated costumes effected
by college youth the world over.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, I’ve got news for you!” cried
Frank Watson, who, as one could tell by the manner
he used toward some of the other students,
was a sophomore. “Great news! Come here,
Bill Hamilton—Bart Haley—you too, Sid Lenton
and Jim Blake. Come here and listen to me.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter now?” asked Bill Hamilton,
a flashily dressed lad. “Has some one left
you money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish some one had,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“Same here,” drawled Bart Haley. “I never
knew how much a fellow could spend until I came
here. I’m up against it hard!”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t money,” remarked Frank. “It’s
worse than that. What do you know about this.
There’s a bunch of new fellows coming here in a
week or so, and they’re about the limit—or at
least I think they’ll be that.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Bart, slightly interested.</p>

<p>“This. There are three fellows coming into
the freshman class. And from what I hear they
have been around pretty much, so they’ll probably
be fresher than usual and will try to run things
here to suit themselves. The know-it-all class, so
to speak.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Bart.</p>

<p>“How’d you hear about this?” demanded Sid
Lenton.</p>

<p>“They are—let me see. I jotted down their
names so’s we’d have ’em handy to use in case
we had to. Here they are—Jerry Hopkins, Bob
Baker and Ned Slade. They’re from Cresville,
and they’re going to bring their auto with them.
Fawncy now!” and Frank assumed a mocking air
and tone.</p>

<p>“I asked you how you heard it,” came from
Sid again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass told me. He’s a friend
of theirs, it seems, and he sent one of them a college
catalogue. That’s how they came to be
wished on to us. It seems that Professor Snodgrass,
who isn’t a bad sort by the way, used to
travel about with the Motor Boys, as their friends
at home call them,” said Frank, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Motor boys?” repeated Bart Haley.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what they used to call themselves.
Think of that—motor boys!”</p>

<p>“Why was that?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, because they did a lot of motoring. Had
motor cycles first, it appears, then they got an
auto, then a motor boat, and then they even had a
submarine!”</p>

<p>“Get out! You’re stringing us!” cried several.</p>

<p>“No, it’s straight!” declared Frank. He sat
down on the grass and continued: “Why, some
fellow even wrote a book—two or three of them
I guess—about these same motor boys. When
Professor Snodgrass told me they were coming
here I pumped him for all he was worth. Thinks
I to myself, if we’re going to have fellows like
that here, who sure will try to walk over us, the
more I know about them the better.</p>

<p>“So he told me all he knew, which was a lot. It
seems he used to go off on bug-hunting expeditions
with them in the auto, the boat or the airship.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Airship!” cried Jim Blake. “You don’t mean
to say they had an airship, do you?”</p>

<p>“That’s what the professor said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s daffy! I’ll never believe that. They
may have had an auto and a motor boat—I’ve
got one of them myself,” said Bill Hamilton.
“But an airship—never!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll find out about that later,” declared
Frank. “Anyhow, some fellow did write about
the motor boys. He made up a story of how they
went overland, and even down into Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Mexico!” exclaimed Harry French.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mexico. And there they discovered a
buried city, or something like that. The professor
made a big find there—some new kind of bug I
guess. And then there’s a book telling how these
motor boys went across the plains, and how they
first went cruising in their motor boat. They were
on the Atlantic, on the Pacific, and in the strange
waters of the Florida Everglades. Some trip,
believe me!”</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose it’s all true?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“The professor says so, and you know what
a stickler he is,” responded Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, if that’s the case, these fellows sure
will try to put it all over us,” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“They may try, but they won’t succeed,” declared
Frank, and there was a vindictive ring to
his voice. “But this isn’t all. Ned, Bob and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Jerry—the motor boys—did go above the clouds
in some sort of motor ship, according to the professor.
They went across the Rockies, and out
over the ocean. Then they went after some kind
of a fortune, and even helped capture some Canadian
smugglers up on the border. And it’s all
in books, too.</p>

<p>“And, as I said, according to Mr. Snodgrass,
these lads went down in a submarine. I didn’t believe
that at first, but he told me of the things
he saw and the specimens he caught, so I guess it’s
true enough.</p>

<p>“Now they’re coming here. They got back
from a long trip on road and river just before
Professor Snodgrass came here to teach, and they
had such lively times that their folks packed them
here for us to look after,” and Frank grinned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll look after ’em all right!” cried Sid.</p>

<p>“That’s what we will,” added Bart Haley.</p>

<p>“If they try to run things here they’ll find that
they’re running themselves into the ground,” declared
Jake Porter.</p>

<p>The group of students around Frank nodded
assent. The boys were, as has been said, sophomores,
and most of them were on the baseball
nine.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ll go out for football?” asked
Ted Newton, captain of the eleven. “We need
some good material.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have new fellows—butters-in
like these three—on the team; would you?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, they’d be eligible for the varsity under
the rules here, which are different from those of
most colleges. I wouldn’t turn any fellow down
just because he’d had some adventures. Cracky!
I’d like a taste of them myself!”</p>

<p>“I tell you these motor boys will be impossible!”
cried Frank. “You’ll see! They’ll think
they’re the whole show, and that we don’t amount
to anything. We can haze them and then we can
sit on ’em good and proper, and that’s what I say
let’s do!”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” drawled Bill Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Are they rich?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“I s’pose they are,” admitted Frank, “or they
couldn’t afford to do all they have done. But
that won’t make any difference to me. I’m going
to snub ’em and sit on ’em, for they’ll be sure to
try to run things.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed some of his cronies.
“We’ll show these motor boys a thing or two at
Boxwood!”</p>

<p>Thus, without having seen our heroes, the coterie
led by Frank Watson decided on a verdict
against them—a verdict that was destined to cause
no end of trouble.</p>

<small>OFF TO COLLEGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry were not able to enter
Boxwood Hall the first week of the fall term.
They had expected to, and had begun to prepare
for that. But some minor difficulties cropped up
in regard to their entrance examinations, and they
were obliged to pass certain tests which were arranged
for by President Cole with the principal
of the Cresville Academy, where the boys had
been in attendance.</p>

<p>Finally, their previous work in their studies was
found to be satisfactory, and, as Frank Watson
informed his chums, the three chums were to enter
the freshman class.</p>

<p>While the boys were busy with their examinations,
their parents—the mothers especially—were
busy preparing their sons’ outfits.</p>

<p>“It’s worse than when we went overland,” complained
Ned, when he had been obliged to pass
judgment on suits, caps, underwear and other
wearing apparel—the outfit he was to take to
college with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’ll soon be over,” was Jerry’s consoling
suggestion.</p>

<p>“The worst of it is,” said Bob, “we may be all
out of date with our clothes when we get to Boxwood
and see what the fellows there are wearing.
We may have to get a lot of new things.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than a cap or two, I guess,”
Jerry said. “We’ll wait about them until we get
there, and find out what kind the fellows are
sporting. We’ll wear our auto caps until then.”</p>

<p>“Auto caps!” cried Bob. “They won’t look
good in the train.”</p>

<p>“Who said anything about a train?” asked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“Why, aren’t we going to Fordham by train?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you tell him about it?” asked the tall
lad of Ned.</p>

<p>“No, Jerry, I forgot.”</p>

<p>“What’s the game?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, Ned and I talked it over,” said Jerry,
“and we decided it would be a good stunt, as long
as we’re going to take our car to college with us,
to motor down in it instead of going by train. I
supposed he had told you, but I guess there was
so much going on that he forgot about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” affirmed Ned.</p>

<p>“Motor down!” Bob exclaimed. “That will
be swell! We can do it easily in a day, and we
can take along our——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lunch!” cut in Ned, taking care to have Jerry
between him and Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me tired!” exclaimed the stout
lad. “I was going to say take our trunks along,
and save a lot of bother with the expressman.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” Jerry said. “Let Chunky alone,
Ned. He’s all right, even if he does eat five times
a day.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re picking on me!” laughed Bob.
“Well, go as far as you like, I can stand it if you
can.”</p>

<p>“Say, I’ll tell you what we might do,” cried
Ned, as he and his chums got into their car for
a spin out into the country, as it was a day or so
yet before they would depart for Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“We might write to Professor Snodgrass, and
ask him what sort of duds the fellows wear there.
Then we’d know what to get and save doubling
up.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that?” asked Jerry, with a queer
look at his chum.</p>

<p>“Of course I do. Why not?”</p>

<p>“You ought to know the professor by this time,”
remarked the tall lad with a laugh. “He doesn’t
know any more about clothes than a bat!”</p>

<p>“I should say not!” chimed in Bob, who was,
as his friends said, “some nifty little dresser.”
“The professor would get styles all mixed up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
his bugs and butterflies,” went on the stout lad.
“He’d tell us that the fellows were wearing sweaters
with double-jointed legs, and trousers with
stripes running around them like that queer beetle
he got when we were down in Mexico. He’d
have just about that much idea of what we wanted
to know.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” assented Ned. “I didn’t
think about that. We’ll just settle the clothes question
when we get there.”</p>

<p>They motored along a pleasant country road,
talking of many things, but chiefly of their coming
stay at Boxwood Hall, and what they would
do when they got there.</p>

<p>“I hope we can room together,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“We’ll have connecting rooms,” Jerry said.
“Mother wrote to the matron, a Mrs. Eastman,
and she wrote back that there were three nice
rooms in the main dormitory of Borton we could
have. So mother clinched them for us. Mother’s
a bit fussy about rooms, and I guess I’m glad she
is.”</p>

<p>“Say, that will be swell all right!” exclaimed
Bob.</p>

<p>“All to the merry!” chimed in Ned.</p>

<p>A little farther along they passed the place
where they had put out the automobile fire some
time previously.</p>

<p>“I wonder what ever became of Mr. Hobson—was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that his name, the fellow we saved?” asked
Ned, musingly.</p>

<p>“That was it—Samuel Hobson,” affirmed Jerry.
“Didn’t I tell you I had a card from him?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied his chums.</p>

<p>“Well, I had. A souvenir card from San Francisco.
He’s out there on business, but expects to
come East again. He said he’d write a letter
when he had time. Sent his regards to all of
you.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder he wouldn’t drop us a line,”
grumbled Bob.</p>

<p>“He apologized for that,” explained Jerry.
“Said he’d lost your addresses, and asked me to
send them on.”</p>

<p>“Well, make mine Boxwood Hall,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Same here,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>Several busy days followed in which last preparations
were made. The boys’ plan to motor to
Boxwood Hall was agreed to by the parents. As
the car was a roomy one there was space in it for
their trunks, as well as for themselves, and, thus
taking their baggage, they would save themselves
considerable trouble.</p>

<p>The boys had looked up the best route to take,
and though the trip was something over a hundred
and fifty miles, they figured that by making an
early start they could reach the college in the late
afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“And it’ll be a whole lot better than traveling
in a stuffy train, fellows,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had been written to again
by the boys, who told of their automobile trip, and
they mentioned the time they expected to arrive.
In reply the little scientist said he would be on the
lookout for them, and he again expressed his
pleasure that they were going to be near him.</p>

<p>“He’s as jolly as a young fellow himself,” declared
Jerry.</p>

<p>The morning for the start came, and after a
substantial breakfast, at least on the part of Bob,
our heroes took their places in the big touring
car.</p>

<p>“Now boys,” said Mr. Slade, who, with Mr.
Baker, had come to the home of Mrs. Hopkins
to see the three off, “remember that you are not
going to college for fun.”</p>

<p>“But we can have a little; can’t we, Dad?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. I want you all to have a good
time within reason. But you must all buckle down
to hard work too. As we said before, you’ve had
more than your share of strenuous adventures.
Leave some for the other fellows. You must prepare
to take your places as men in the world soon,
and a good education is the best preparation.”</p>

<p>“I agree with what Mr. Slade says,” added the
banker. “We don’t want to be too preachy, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
boys, dig in hard now, and let us all be proud of
you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we shall be,” said Mrs. Hopkins,
and there was a smile on her face, though she
found it rather hard to let Jerry go for such a
long time. Still he was used to being away from
home, and his mother knew he could take care
of himself, as could his chums.</p>

<p>Good-byes echoed and re-echoed as Jerry
started the motor and, throwing in the gears, let
the clutch slip into place. Hands were waved,
and then our three heroes swung down the road on
their way to college. It was a momentous occasion
for them.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, fellows—wish I were going—don’t
forget to write—send me tickets—football game—maybe
I can come—it’ll be great—hope you
play and win every game—good-bye!”</p>

<p>It was Andy Rush, of course, and the little chap
ran alongside the automobile for a few feet as he
delivered his rapid-fire remarks.</p>

<p>“I wonder what will happen to him when he
goes to college,” mused Bob.</p>

<p>“He’ll have to dictate his recitations into a
phonograph,” said Jerry, “and when the prof
wants to listen he’ll have to run it at half speed,
or he wouldn’t catch a word.”</p>

<p>“Oh well, Andy’s all right. He’s done us lots
of good turns,” declared Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed his chums.</p>

<p>Little of incident marked their morning trip,
save that Ned and Bob had a discussion as to
which was the best place to eat, a dispute that
ended when Jerry picked out an altogether different
restaurant, and stopped the car in front of it.</p>

<p>After a brief rest they were on their way again.
Now they were in unfamiliar country, and several
times they had to stop to ask which road to take,
as the road map seemed faulty.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to get there before dark at
this rate,” said Bob, as he looked at his watch,
and noted a sign-board which stated that Fordham
was still many miles away.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ve got good headlights,” Jerry
said.</p>

<p>It clouded up about four o’clock, and at five
was so dark that the headlights had to be set
aglow. At a cross-road Jerry stopped the car.</p>

<p>“Hop out, Ned, and see which turn to take,”
he said.</p>

<p>Ned, with a pocket flashlight, examined the
board.</p>

<p>“Say, this is queer!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Why, one of these roads goes to Lawrenceville
and the other to Ogdenburg. We’ve come
the wrong way, fellows. Fordham isn’t anywhere
around here!”</p>

</div>


<p>Momentary silence followed the rather disconcerting
remark made by Ned after his discovery.
Then Jerry asked:</p>

<p>“Are you sure about that? Look around.
Maybe there’s another sign-board somewhere else
that gives information about Fordham.”</p>

<p>“This is the only one there is,” declared Ned,
flashing his light about, “and it doesn’t intimate
that such a place as Fordham even exists.”</p>

<p>“Then we must have come the wrong road!”
exclaimed Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, fine! How’d you guess it? That’s a brilliant
head you have!” said Ned, rather sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t my fault,” observed Bob. “I
wasn’t guiding the car.”</p>

<p>“No, I s’pose it’s up to me,” admitted Jerry.
“Though I’m sure I took the turn that last fellow
we asked told us to take.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did all right,” agreed Ned. “It was
that farmer who misdirected us. I beg your pardon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Bob, for jumping at you that way. But it
makes me mad to think we’ve gotten on the wrong
road, and we won’t get to Boxwood until after
supper.”</p>

<p>“Getting hungry?” asked Jerry. “That’s
Chunky’s role, you know.”</p>

<p>“Roll or bread—I’d be glad of either,” said
Ned. “Yes, I am hungry. I didn’t eat as much
lunch as you fellows did. Now go ahead, Bob,
and lay it into me. I deserve it.”</p>

<p>Bob reached under the rear seat and held up
a package.</p>

<p>“I’ll lay this into you, Ned,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the complaining one.</p>

<p>“Grub! Sandwiches, cake and so on.”</p>

<p>“Grub!” Jerry exclaimed. “Where’d you get
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I had the waiter in the restaurant put it
up for me. I thought we might get hungry before
supper, but I didn’t think we would get lost.
It’ll come in handy, won’t it?”</p>

<p>“It’ll come in stomachicly, to coin a new word,”
declared Ned. “Chunky, if ever I say anything
again about your eats, just you remind me of this
occasion.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the stout youth.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t starve, that’s sure,” Jerry
said. “But the question is which road are we to
take?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Neither one of these, I vote,” said Bob.
“They don’t go where we want to go. I say, let’s
go back until we get to another cross highway,
and that may have a sign on that we didn’t notice
before which will direct us to Fordham.”</p>

<p>“I guess Bob’s right,” conceded Jerry. “Back
we go.”</p>

<p>“And we can eat on the way,” Bob went on;
and neither of his chums joked him this time.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointed and chagrined at the
outcome of their automobile trip, or rather, at
the prospective outcome, the boys put back. They
had counted on arriving at Boxwood Hall in some
“style” with their big car. Not that the three
chums cared so much about showing off, but they
felt they had a right to make a certain impression,
since, according to present plans, they were
to remain at the college for some time.</p>

<p>But now they would arrive after dark, and they
would be met by strange professors and college
officials (all save Professor Snodgrass), they
would be late for supper, and would have no
chance to view the college until morning.</p>

<p>“Hang that farmer, anyhow!” murmured
Jerry.</p>

<p>“I wish he had to go without his suppers for a
week,” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re not so badly off,” declared Bob,
as he was munching a sandwich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bob wouldn’t want any one condemned to
go without food,” said Jerry. “Well, I suppose it
was my own fault in a way. I should have consulted
the map after that fellow told us which
turn to take. We’ll know better next time.”</p>

<p>“There’s a house,” remarked Ned. “Suppose
we inquire there.”</p>

<p>“No!” decided Jerry. “That’s a farmer’s
house, and I won’t trust any more farmers. I’ll
go on back to the last turn we made. There’s a
garage not far from there, and they’ll know the
road, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>It was not a long ride back to the place where
Jerry felt they had made the wrong turn, and a
few minutes more took them to the garage. But
it was now quite dark.</p>

<p>“Fordham—um, yes,” said the garage man, reflectively.
“I should say you <em>did</em> take the wrong
turn!”</p>

<p>“Well, please tell us how to take the right one,”
begged Jerry.</p>

<p>“The right one happens to be a left one,” said
the man with a laugh. Then he gave them the
proper directions, and said they ought to be at
Boxwood Hall in about an hour.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Ned, as they started away
once more. “On with the dance!”</p>

<p>“Speaking of dances, I wonder if they ever have
any at the college?” asked Bob, reflectively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure they do!” exclaimed Ned, who of late
had taken up fox-trotting. “Didn’t the catalogue
say that all proper facilities were given for the
best social life. And what is social life, I’d like
to know, without a dance now and then?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll get your share of it,” remarked
Jerry, his eyes on the road ahead, for it was an
unfamiliar one to him, and, though the garage
man had said it was a fine, straight highway, Jerry
was taking no chances. The powerful electric
lights made a fine illumination far ahead.</p>

<p>Now it might have been reasonably expected
that Fate, if you choose to call it such, having
dealt our heroes one blow, would refrain from giving
them another, at least for a while. But it was
not to be.</p>

<p>About a half hour after having left the garage
they came to an obstruction across the road. It
was in the form of a big sawhorse such as is used
in cities to block streets when repair work is being
done. From the barrier hung a red lantern.</p>

<p>“Hello! What does this mean?” asked Jerry,
bringing the car up with a screeching of brakes.</p>

<p>“Looks like danger,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s some kind of a sign,” said Ned. “I’ll
get out and read it.”</p>

<p>With his pocket flashlight he inspected a placard
that was tacked on the big sawhorse.</p>

<p>“It says the bridge just ahead is being repaired,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and can’t be used,” Ned called back to his chums.
“And it says to go back half a mile, and take the
road to the left.”</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t luck!” cried Jerry. “Will
we ever get to Boxwood Hall?”</p>

<p>“There’s no help for it,” remarked Ned. “We
can’t go over a dangerous bridge, that’s sure. The
only thing to do is to go back. It won’t delay us
much, as the road the sign mentions isn’t a five
minutes’ ride back.”</p>

<p>“No, but it may take us on a roundabout way,”
objected Jerry. “That’s what I’m thinking of.
But I guess it’s the only thing we can do. I reckon
the garage man didn’t know about the bridge.”</p>

<p>So back they turned for the second time, and,
following the directions, they took the road to the
left, speeding along as fast as they dared.</p>

<p>“Who proposed this auto trip, anyhow?”
grumbled Ned.</p>

<p>“I did,” confessed Jerry. “But I guess it
would have been better to have come by train,
and have had a chauffeur bring our car on later.
I’m sorry, fellows, that——”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right,” Ned hastened to say. “I
was only joking. I don’t know what’s the matter
with me to-night. I seem to be on the outs all
around.”</p>

<p>“It’s your liver,” said Jerry with a laugh. “I
don’t hold it against you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fox-trotting is good for it,” observed Bob.</p>

<p>“Good for what?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Sluggish and torpid livers. I guess that’s
what you’ve got.”</p>

<p>“Get out!” laughed Ned. “I only have one
liver.”</p>

<p>They sped along, and presently a new moon
showed above the horizon, shining now and then
through the masses of scudding clouds. The road
was good, and Jerry had turned the wheel over
to Ned, as the latter had not driven much that
day, and Jerry was rather tired from the strain.</p>

<p>They came to the top of a little hill, and saw,
not far away, a group of buildings revealed in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>“There she is!” exclaimed Bob. “There’s Boxwood
Hall!”</p>

<p>Jerry and Ned peered at the structures.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like the pictures,” declared
Ned, dubiously.</p>

<p>“Just what I was going to say,” remarked
Jerry. “It doesn’t look a bit like Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“What else could it be?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless some of the buildings
have been destroyed since that catalogue came out.
But if that had happened Professor Snodgrass
would have told us,” Ned declared.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see in a few minutes,” observed
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>They motored on until they came to where a
gateway at the roadside led up to the group of
buildings they had noticed, and then, in the glare
of their headlights they read over the arch:</p>

<p class="noi adauthor">KENWELL MILITARY ACADEMY</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Then Jerry burst
out with:</p>

<p>“Well, what in the world is happening to us?”</p>

<p>“We’re jinxed!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>Bob said nothing.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you add to the general hilarity?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, I—I’m—stumped!” murmured the stout
lad.</p>

<p>“If that’s all you can think of to say you might
better have kept still,” laughed Ned. “We sure
have been up against it to-day!”</p>

<p>“About as bad luck as we ever had,” admitted
Jerry. “Still it might be worse.”</p>

<p>“The worst is yet to come,” quoted Bob, with
a laugh. They all joined in, for, after all, there
was a funny side to the whole thing.</p>

<p>“Did that sign where the red lantern was say
the left road went to Fordham?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No, it didn’t say that,” admitted Ned. “But
it didn’t say anything about any other road.
There wasn’t any choice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to get this straight now,” said
Jerry, in a determined tone. “I’m going up to
that academy and get them to draw us a plan of
the right road to take. No more mistakes for
me!”</p>

<p>“Here’s some one coming now,” remarked Bob.
Into the glare of the headlights came a man. He
stepped to one side, to get out of the too brilliant
illumination.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, sir,” said Jerry, “but we are trying
to find Boxwood Hall, near Fordham. Can
you direct us to it?”</p>

<p>“Boxwood Hall! Of course I can. I am an
instructor there, but I have had the misfortune
to——”</p>

<p>Something in the voice caused the boys to give
a simultaneous shout of:</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass! It’s Professor Snodgrass!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S SHOES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry tumbled out of the automobile
in such haste that it might have been called
a “dead heat,” to use a sporting term. They made
a rush for the little man standing at the side of
the road near the path of light from the automobile
lamps.</p>

<p>“Professor Snodgrass!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Is it really you?” demanded Ned.</p>

<p>“Our good luck has started!” was Bob’s contribution
to the general fund.</p>

<p>As for the little man in the road, he did not
seem to know what to do or say.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardons, young gentlemen,” he
said. “Are you students from Boxwood Hall, or
from the military academy here? I see you have
a machine, and if you are from Boxwood Hall I
would ask that——”</p>

<p>“We’re not <em>from</em> Boxwood, but we want to <em>go</em>
there!” cried Jerry. “Don’t you know us, Professor
Snodgrass? Take a look!”</p>

<p>He whirled the little man around into the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
so he could look at the three chums. Then a great
change came over the professor’s face.</p>

<p>“Why—why—why, it’s the motor boys!” he
cried. “Ned, Bob and Jerry! Bless my soul!
But I <em>am</em> glad to see you! What are you doing
here? I thought you were coming to Boxwood
Hall, and I find you at the gates of the military
academy.”</p>

<p>“It’s all a mistake, Professor! It’s all a mistake!
It’s all wrong!” laughed Jerry. “It’s too
long a story to tell now, but we’ll give it to you by
degrees. We’ve been ever since the early morning
traveling from Cresville here, and more things
have happened than you could shake a stick at.
But how comes it you are over here?”</p>

<p>“You may well ask that,” returned Professor
Snodgrass. “I have had my troubles too. I set
off this afternoon to gather a few specimens of
<i lang="el" xml:lang="el">lepidoptera</i>——”</p>

<p>“Leopards!” exclaimed Bob. “I didn’t know
there were any around here. Did they break out
of a circus?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear boy!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass.
“You must brush up on your Greek if you
are to be one of my pupils. <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Lepidoptera</i> is formed
of two Greek words, meaning a scale, or husk,
and a wing, and by <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">lepidoptera</i> we mean butterflies
and moths.”</p>

<p>“Now will you be good?” murmured Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had heard of a certain rather rare variety
of moth which had been seen in this vicinity,”
went on the professor, “and though it was rather
late in the year to hope to get a specimen, I set
off this afternoon with my specimen box and net,
having finished my class work. I came over from
Fordham to the town of Bundton by train. Bundton
is the nearest station to the military academy,
and about fifteen miles from Fordham.</p>

<p>“But though I tramped all over the fields, and
even ventured into a swamp, where this moth is
said to be sometimes seen, I was unsuccessful.
Not a one did I see. And I stayed so late that I
missed the last train back to Fordham, since the
summer schedule has been withdrawn. So I
started to walk, hoping I might find a garage on
my way where I could hire a car. I had no idea
of meeting you boys, though I remember now this
is the day you said you would arrive. It is most
unfortunate!</p>

<p>“I mean it is unfortunate that I did not get
the moth I was after, but I am very glad I met
you boys. If you will kindly take me into your
car I can put you on the shortest and most direct
road to Fordham, which I am as anxious to reach
as are you, for I have some work to do in preparation
for to-morrow’s lessons.”</p>

<p>“Say! this is the best yet!” cried Bob. “To
think of meeting you this way! We’d about given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
up, and were going to ask the direction from some
one in Kenwell Academy. Sort of asking aid and
comfort of the enemy. I suppose they are the
enemies of Boxwood Hall, when it comes to
sports; aren’t they, Professor?”</p>

<p>“Rivals, not enemies,” answered the little scientist.
“Yes, they play against our boys. I believe
their football nine is to meet our basketball eleven
soon.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the professor.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Jerry. “How are you,
anyhow, Professor Snodgrass?”</p>

<p>“My health has been excellent, thank you. I
like it very much at Boxwood, and I think you will
also. I am very glad you came. And now, I
think, we had better start. I should have been
back hours ago, but it could not be helped. I had
forgotten about the change in the trains, and I
counted on getting for the return trip one that I
have often taken.”</p>

<p>“What’s that you have in your hand, Professor?”
asked Ned, observing that the little scientist
carried a pair of overshoes in one hand in addition
to his specimen box which was slung on a
strap over his shoulder, and his butterfly net,
which he carried in the other hand.</p>

<p>“In my hand? Oh, my overshoes, of course.
Why, how careless of me! And my feet are soaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
wet! I brought my rubbers with me in my
specimen box, thinking I might need them in the
swamp. And it was very wet!</p>

<p>“I took them out, to put them on, and, just
then, I saw what I thought was a new kind of
butterfly. I rushed for it, but it was only a leaf.”</p>

<p>“And you have been carrying your rubbers in
your hand ever since?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I—I fear I have,” answered the collector,
looking down at his wet and soggy shoes. “It
is very careless of me. But I dare say they will
dry out on the ride to Boxwood Hall. How fortunate
that I should have met you!”</p>

<p>“Best piece of luck in the world!” cried Jerry.
“Now, come on, Professor, and we’ll make short
work of the distance. Fifteen miles I think you
said it was to Fordham?”</p>

<p>“That is by railroad,” was the reply. “It’s a
little longer by road, as we have to skirt Lake
Carmona. But if I know anything about you
motor boys I know you won’t be long.”</p>

<p>“Indeed not!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“Do you think we’ll be too late for supper?”
asked Bob, and neither of his chums rebuked him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid it is a little late for the usual
meal,” said the professor. “But I can invite you
into my own residence and we will dine together.
I shall like that above all things. Don’t worry
about eating, Bob.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t now, Professor,” and the stout youth
sighed in relief.</p>

<p>They went back to the automobile, the boys
looking with some curiosity at the lighted buildings
of the military academy.</p>

<p>“That’s some place!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is considered a very good school,” the
professor said, “but they are absolutely <em>nil</em> when
it comes to zoology. They do not give half the
proper attention to it. At Boxwood Hall it is
made a specialty, though I have also to lecture
on other subjects. And now boys, tell me all about
yourselves and your adventures.”</p>

<p>“First take off your wet shoes,” directed Jerry,
as Professor Snodgrass entered the tonneau of the
automobile. “You can wrap your feet in some
blankets. It’s quite chilly to-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered the professor. “I
might, that is very true. I will do as you say.”</p>

<p>He removed his sodden foot gear and then, as
Jerry turned the automobile around, and set off on
the road, directed by the professor, the boys took
turns in telling of the happenings of the day,
which were many and varied.</p>

<p>On his side, Professor Snodgrass mentioned
many points about Boxwood Hall, and answered,
as best he could, questions regarding the nine, the
eleven, the basket ball five and other lines of
sport, for which the college was noted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“What sort of fellows shall we meet?” Ned
demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, a very fine class,” the professor replied.
“We have many sons of wealthy parents here, as
well as others, less well off in worldly goods, but
who are fine students. You’ll like it here.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure we shall!” exclaimed Jerry, and his
chums murmured their assent.</p>

<p>The boys could gather little idea of the nature
of the country round Boxwood Hall, as the darkness
had fallen. But Professor Snodgrass knew
the roads well, as he said. All summer he had
tramped them in search of butterflies and moths,
which was his latest “fad,” if what to him was a
serious matter may be so termed.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” exclaimed the little scientist,
as he told Ned to make a certain turn. “Up this
road, and then to the left, and you’ll be near my
house. I have a whole cottage to myself, and a
most excellent cook.”</p>

<p>“Good!” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“So you had better come in to supper with me,”
went on the professor. “Afterward, I will take
you in and introduce you to Dr. Cole, and Mr.
Wallace Thornton, the proctor, with whom you
will register. Then you will be shown to your
rooms, and can meet some of the boys.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better put that off until morning,”
suggested Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Just as you like,” agreed the scientist.</p>

<p>As the automobile rolled on the three chums
had a glimpse of many buildings scattered over
the green campus, which sloped down to the
shores of Lake Carmona. It was too dark for
the boys to see much, but what they had a glimpse
of made them, more than ever, inclined to like
the place.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be great!” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>“And when we get our motor boat here,” added
Jerry, as he looked toward the lake, “we will
have <em>some</em> times—believe me!”</p>

<p>“This is my residence,” put in the professor,
indicating a small, red, brick building covered with
ivy, as the boys could see in the glare of the automobile
lamps. “Not all of the faculty have separate
dwellings, but my zoological collections are
so large that I needed plenty of room, so I was
assigned to this house. It is very comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Where can we leave the auto?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, there is a garage on the premises, though
I have no car. You may keep yours there if
you like.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” said Jerry.</p>

<p>For the time being they left the machine in the
road, and proceeded up the gravel walk. Jerry
noticed that the professor seemed to be hobbling
in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you hurt your feet in the swamp?” the
tall lad asked.</p>

<p>“Hurt my feet? No, not that I know of. Ah—I
see! Bless my soul! I’ve forgotten to put
on my shoes that I took off to dry. I was wondering
what hurt me.”</p>

<p>Jerry had hard work to keep from roaring with
laughter. For the professor, in his socks, was
walking over the sharp gravel, carrying his shoes
and overshoes in one hand, and his butterfly net
in the other. His face was a picture as he looked
down at his feet in the illumination of the incandescent
lamp on his front porch.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” he murmured again. “I am
getting very forgetful, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“He’s not getting it—he’s <em>got</em> it!” murmured
Bob.</p>

<p>“Come in, boys, come in!” went on the professor,
as he stepped off the gravel to the softer
grass. “We’ll have a nice supper and a long
talk.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured Bob.</p>

<p>“It’s the supper he’s thinking of, not the talk,”
said Ned to Jerry.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>A COOL RECEPTION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Professor Snodgrass had said his was a
roomy house, and so it was as regards the house
itself. But there was not much room in it, as the
boys soon saw, for even the hall was filled with
boxes, cases and other receptacles for holding
what Ned, Bob and Jerry rightly guessed to be
specimens of bugs, butterflies and other objects
dear to the heart of the enthusiastic scientist.</p>

<p>“Make yourselves right at home, boys,” urged
the professor, as they went in. He put away his
butterfly net and the specimen box he carried over
his shoulder, and then called:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Gilcuddy! Mrs. Gilcuddy!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! What is it?” asked a voice from
the kitchen.</p>

<p>“We will have company to supper, Mrs. Gilcuddy,”
went on the professor. “Put on three
extra plates.”</p>

<p>A pleasant-faced woman came into the dining
room.</p>

<p>“And you might take these,” the professor went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
on, holding out his wet shoes to her. “They’ll
need drying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if you haven’t been and done it again!”
she cried, raising her hands in dismay. “You’ll
catch cold, Professor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think not,” he said mildly. “These
young gentlemen, friends of mine, made me take
off my shoes and wrap my feet in a blanket. They
are really quite warm now. Sit down, boys. Mrs.
Gilcuddy will soon have supper ready. Sit down.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to know where they’re going to sit!”
exclaimed the housekeeper. “Every chair in the
place holds some of your specimens, Mr. Snodgrass.”</p>

<p>“We’ll clear some of them away,” offered
Jerry. “We’ve been with the professor before.”</p>

<p>He started to lift an accumulation of boxes off
one of the chairs, but the little scientist, dropping
the shoes, which Mrs. Gilcuddy had not taken,
cried:</p>

<p>“Look out, Jerry! Handle that gently. That
contains some of my choicest specimens of <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Argynnis
atalantis</i>.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Jerry. “A new kind of
fish?”</p>

<p>“It is the mountain silverspot butterfly,” the
professor explained. “I was all day getting two
specimens. I wouldn’t lose them for the world.
Bring me my slippers, Mrs. Gilcuddy, and I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
clear off the chairs myself,” and this he did after
some confusion.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, now you’re here, let me say how
glad I am to see you all,” said Professor Snodgrass,
when the three chums had made themselves
ready for the supper which could be smelled cooking
in the kitchen. “I am very glad you came.”</p>

<p>“So are we,” echoed Bob, his eyes on the door
leading to the kitchen.</p>

<p>During the meal there was much talk. The
professor told what he had been doing since he
had last seen the boys; while, on their part, they
related their experiences and the doings which
had led to their being sent to Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>“You’ll like it here,” declared the scientist.
“We have some of the most scholarly minds of
the country at this college. You will gain knowledge
that will be of unsurpassed value to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all very well,” replied Ned, “but we
came here to have a little fun, too, Professor.
Are there any lively students here?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I believe so,” was the answer,
given somewhat doubtfully though. “Some were
too lively, I believe, for we had a faculty meeting
yesterday to decide what had best be done
about some of the young gentlemen who screwed
shut the door of one of the instructor’s rooms so
he could not get out in time to attend his classes.”</p>

<p>“That sounds encouraging.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” echoed Ned.</p>

<p>“And speaking of lively students,” put in Mrs.
Gilcuddy, who seemed to be more than an ordinary
servant, “you might mention, Professor, that
the boys put a cow up on your front porch where
the poor creature couldn’t get down until part of
the railing was cut away.”</p>

<p>“Did they do that?” asked Jerry eagerly.</p>

<p>“I—I believe they did,” admitted the scientist.</p>

<p>“Better and better!” murmured Ned. “I can
see we are going to like it here. There are some
live ones.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing about it,” observed Bob in
a low voice to his chums, after the meal, while
the professor had gone to put on a dry pair of
shoes, “she sure is some cook!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“The professor’s housekeeper, Mrs. Gilcuddy.
I hope he invites us over often, in case we don’t
find the commons good.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess the college food will be all right,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>At Boxwood Hall, as at other colleges, some
of the students ate in “commons,” or in the college
dining rooms, the expense being added to their
tuition bills. Others preferred to board in private
families, while some formed “eating clubs.”
Our friends had decided, for the time being at
least, to dine at the college table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, if you’ll come with me,” the professor
said as he came down stairs, “I’ll take you over
to the proctor, Mr. Thornton, and introduce you,
so that you may register and be shown to your
rooms. Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—er—do you think you had better
go that way?” asked Jerry, smiling at the instructor.</p>

<p>“What way? Why, is anything wrong?”</p>

<p>The professor looked at his hands. He was
carrying his collar and necktie.</p>

<p>“Bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “I did forget
to put them on; didn’t I? I was wondering where
I had put my specimen of <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Neonympha eurytus</i>,
or little wood-satyr butterfly. I wanted to show
it to Professor Axton. I must have mislaid it.
But never mind now. I’ll look for it later.”</p>

<p>He put on his collar and tie and accompanied
the boys out of doors. The clouds had somewhat
cleared away now and the new moon illumined
the campus and silvered the surface of
Lake Carmona. The boys looked about them at
the groups of college buildings.</p>

<p>“It is a dandy place!” murmured Jerry softly.</p>

<p>“It sure is,” agreed his chums.</p>

<p>The boys found Proctor Thornton to be a
rather stern-looking gentleman, who seemed to be
on the alert and with an air as if he were constantly
saying, or thinking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now it doesn’t make any difference how innocent
you look, I know you have either been up
to some mischief or are going to make some. I
won’t accept any excuses. I know boys and you
can’t deceive me.”</p>

<p>“But maybe he’s all right for all that,” said
Bob to his chums, as they came away after registering.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t <em>look</em> very promising,” declared
Ned.</p>

<p>“But I guess we can make out as well as the
rest of the boys,” came from Jerry.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass had left them in Mr.
Thornton’s office, the scientist stating he had some
work to prepare for the morrow, and would see
the boys in the morning. The proctor had gone
out to look for Mrs. Eastman, who was the matron
in charge of the dormitory where the boys
would sleep. Mr. Thornton wanted her to take
Ned, Bob and Jerry to their rooms, and the discussion
about him took place during his absence.</p>

<p>“This way, if you please, young gentlemen,”
he called a little later. “You will be assigned to
classes to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman proved to be a motherly-looking
woman, and the boys took a liking to her at once.</p>

<p>“New students, eh?” she remarked pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Just arrived, after an all day try at getting
here,” said Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed. “Have you had supper?”</p>

<p>They told her of the professor’s hospitality.</p>

<p>“Here are your rooms,” she informed them,
as she stopped in a corridor on the second floor.
“You’ll find the rules on cards tacked to each
door. The rooms connect.”</p>

<p>“Say, these are all right!”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better!”</p>

<p>“We’ll have good times here all right!”</p>

<p>Thus exclaimed Ned, Bob and Jerry as they
were ushered into their new quarters. The rooms,
though small, were tastefully furnished, and our
heroes had materials in their trunks to decorate
them as college rooms should be decorated, according
to the accepted usage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eastman had hurried away, after promising
to have the boys’ baggage brought from their
automobile by one of the porters, and while waiting
for their trunks the trio walked through the
three connecting rooms, making their selection.
Jerry took the middle apartment, with Bob on
the left and Ned on the right.</p>

<p>As the porter left, having deposited the trunks,
Jerry saw a door on the opposite side of the corridor
open, and a lad’s head was thrust out. His
room was well lighted, and two other students
could be seen in with him. He looked curiously
across at the newcomers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello you over there!” he exclaimed.
“What’re your names?”</p>

<p>Jerry informed him. There was a moment of
silence, while the youth in the door seemed to
be reporting to his friends. Jerry heard the words
“motor boys.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go over and make friends with them,”
suggested Ned. “They may be sophomores, but
I guess they won’t haze us the first night.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jerry agreed, while Bob nodded
his assent.</p>

<p>The head of the lad looking out from the room
across the hall was drawn in, and the door closed.
Our heroes walked across the corridor, noting that
on the portal was a card bearing the names
Frank Watson, Bart Haley and William Hamilton.
Jerry tapped on the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?”</p>

<p>“We just came in,” Jerry said. “We’re from
across the hall. We were speaking to you a moment
ago. We’d like to have a talk.”</p>

<p>Sounds of whispering could be heard, and then
the voice that had first spoken said in no friendly
tones:</p>

<p>“We’re too busy to talk now. You’ll have to
wait. Come around some other time.”</p>

<p>Our three heroes looked at one another.</p>

<p>“Well, if this isn’t a cool reception I’d like to
know what is,” said Ned in a low voice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE PROFESSOR’S DILEMMA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Slowly Ned, Bob and Jerry returned to their
rooms. They did not speak for a moment, but
sat down and looked at one another. Then Ned
burst out with:</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“I hope all the fellows at Boxwood won’t be
like those in there,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand it,” remarked Jerry. “We
didn’t do or say anything out of the way; did
we?”</p>

<p>“I can’t see how we did,” returned Ned. “I
guess they’re plain snobs, that’s all, and the less
we have to do with them the better.”</p>

<p>“They don’t seem to <em>want</em> us to have anything
to do with them,” came from Bob.</p>

<p>“The idea of not even opening the door,” went
on Jerry. “I should think the older students
ought to make the new ones feel at home.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out for a walk,” proposed Bob. “It’s
early yet and the rules say we don’t have to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
until eleven,” and he glanced at the card on the
back of the door.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s take a walk,” agreed Jerry. “We
can fix up our rooms to-morrow.”</p>

<p>They strolled across the campus, noting the various
groups of college buildings, where the other
dormitories were located, the different “schools”
where various specialties were taught, the gymnasium,
and the president’s house, which was rather
a pretentious one.</p>

<p>“Yes, it sure is a nice place—but I don’t like
the only specimens of students we’ve yet come in
contact with,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“There’s the diamond over there,” said Bob,
after a pause, as he indicated the baseball field.
“Let’s go and take a look at it.”</p>

<p>“The football gridiron would be more in keeping
now,” suggested Jerry.</p>

<p>As they were walking along a path that led
between two of the buildings, a voice hailed them:</p>

<p>“Hello there, freshies! What do you mean
by trespassing on the sophs’ walk. Get off there!”</p>

<p>The three chums stopped, and looked around.
In the light of a lamp, one of many that glowed
on the college grounds, they saw a lad hastening
toward them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you fellows?” he
demanded. “Don’t you know no freshies are allowed
here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, we didn’t know it,” said Jerry. “We’ve
just arrived, and we’re not on to all the rules
yet.”</p>

<p>“We tried to get some one to put us wise,”
put in Ned, “but we got snubbed for our pains.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” asked the other, in some surprise.
“That doesn’t sound like the Boxwood
Hall spirit.”</p>

<p>“It’s so all the same,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Who was it?” asked the lad who had hailed
the three.</p>

<p>Our heroes paused for a moment.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” the other continued quickly. “I
shouldn’t have asked you that. But I’m telling
you no freshmen are allowed on this walk. College
custom, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” Jerry said, good-naturedly.
“We’ll move on.”</p>

<p>“My name’s Newton,” said the lad who had
made the objection. “Edward Newton—but they
all call me Ted. Shake!”</p>

<p>He extended his hand and while this form of
welcome was being gone through with Ned, Bob
and Jerry introduced themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know your names all right,” declared
Ted. “We’ve heard about you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing out of the way, I hope?” came from
Bob.</p>

<p>“No,” was the rather hesitating answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
“You’ve been pretty well discussed by a certain
crowd on account of some of the things the professor
said you fellows had done. Did you really
do all that?”</p>

<p>“We’d have to know what Professor Snodgrass
said about us,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you some time. But this is what I
want to know. I’m captain of the eleven, and I
want to know if you play football?”</p>

<p>“We haven’t in some time,” admitted Ned.</p>

<p>Ted Newton shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then there’s no use putting you in at this
stage,” he said. “I’m sorry, too, for you look
husky. I need some experienced players. I’ve
got enough candidates in the beginner’s class.
Well, it can’t be helped. You know here we let
freshmen play on the varsity.”</p>

<p>“So we’ve heard,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“We play baseball,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s out of my line,” Ted replied. “I play
a little, but Frank Watson is captain of the nine.”</p>

<p>“Frank Watson!” exclaimed Jerry. “He rooms
across the hall from us in Borton.”</p>

<p>“Then you have good rooms, for that dormitory
is the newest and best at Boxwood Hall.”</p>

<p>“What sort of fellow is this Watson?” asked
Ned, who, in common with his chums, had taken
a sudden liking to genial Ted Newton. “The
reason I ask is,” went on Ned, “that a little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ago we went across to his room to ask him to put
us wise to the ropes, but he didn’t even open his
door. Told us to call later, though he, or some
of the fellows with him called to us when our
trunks were being put in. What sort of boy is
he?”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s a queer sort of chap at times,”
was the slow answer from the football captain.
“He’s quite an athlete, and a good baseball
player. Only he’s rather headstrong, and I’m
not telling tales out of school, for he admits it
himself. Yes, Frank has a will of his own, and
it isn’t altogether his fault, either.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” inquired Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, Frank’s father died when he was a
small chap, and his mother was too indulgent
with him. I know his folks. His family and
mine are distantly related, and we come from
the same town. Frank’s mother let him have his
own way too much, and as he got older and found
out he could have what he wanted by insisting
on it, why he insisted, and it wasn’t altogether
good for him.</p>

<p>“He got into bad company and was on the
road that doesn’t lead to any particular good,
though I won’t say that Frank was actually bad.
Then his mother married again, and it made all
the difference in the world to Frank.”</p>

<p>“How was that?” Jerry inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, Frank’s stepfather proved to be just the
right kind of man to take Frank in charge. And
he did it, too, just in time. The best part of it
is that Frank really loves his new parent.</p>

<p>“When his stepfather saw which way Frank
was drifting, he took him away from his companions,
and sent him here. It has been the making
of Frank, headstrong as he is. He’s getting some
of it taken out of him here, but he can stand the
loss of more,” went on Ted. “He came here as a
freshman and was well hazed. Now he’s a soph,
and he has a lot of friends.”</p>

<p>“But is that any reason why he should turn
the cold shoulder to us?” asked Ned. “Just because
we’re freshmen?”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Ted slowly. “It isn’t. Frank
ought to have had the decency to put you wise to
what you wanted to know, even if he didn’t care
to make friends.”</p>

<p>“Is there any reason why he shouldn’t care to
make friends?” asked Bob. “Not that we want
to force ourselves on him,” he added.</p>

<p>“Well, I did hear a little talk about him and
his crowd saying they were afraid you fellows
might come here with—well, if you’ll excuse me
for mentioning it—with swelled heads, is about
the best way I can put it.”</p>

<p>“Swelled heads!” cried Jerry. “What in the
world have we to puff out our chests over?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s those things you did—having so
many adventures you know. Did you really go
up in an airship and down in a submarine, the way
Professor Snodgrass tells?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, we did,” said Ned. “But that’s
nothing. Any one could have done the same things
we did.”</p>

<p>“Say, you sure have seen life!” exclaimed Ted
admiringly. “But I guess that’s all that ails
Frank. He thought you might try to lord it
over us here, I guess.”</p>

<p>“He’s away off!” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“I can see he is,” admitted Ted. “But, as I
told you, Frank is headstrong. Once he gets a
notion it’s hard to get it out of him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we shall take the trouble
to make him change his mind,” remarked Jerry.
“If he wants to think that way about us, let him.
We can get along without him.”</p>

<p>“Sure you can!” agreed Ted. “Don’t let it
worry you any. There are plenty of other fellows
in Boxwood Hall. Are you all settled?”</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t put up any of our stuff,” said
Ned.</p>

<p>“Are you in our dormitory?” Bob inquired.</p>

<p>“No, I live at the Bull—that’s the junior frat
house you know. Drop over and see me some
time.”</p>

<p>“We will,” promised the three, and then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Ted hurried on, explaining that he was due at a
class meeting, Ned remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, <em>he’s</em> some sort of a chap, <em>he</em> is! I like
<em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Quite a contrast to Frank Watson,” added
Jerry.</p>

<p>After strolling about the college grounds a little
longer our friends went back to their rooms.
The door of the apartment across the hall, which
had the three names on it, was closed, but from
within came the sounds of talk and laughter.</p>

<p>“They seem to be having a good time,” observed
Bob, rather wistfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Ned. “I meant to ask Newton
about those other two—Bart Haley and Will
Hamilton. I wonder if they’re like Frank Watson?”</p>

<p>“Most likely,” argued Jerry. “They’re roommates
all right, and they must be congenial or
they wouldn’t be together. Well, we don’t need
to worry.”</p>

<p>They sat down to talk matters over, but soon
the talk was punctuated with yawns, for the day
had been a wearying one with the long automobile
trip.</p>

<p>“I vote for bed!” suddenly cried Jerry, and
his motion was seconded twice.</p>

<p>Coming out of their rooms the next morning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
go to chapel, Ned, Bob and Jerry saw Frank
Watson and his two chums leaving their apartment
across the hall. Our three heroes bowed,
having agreed to give the others every chance to
make advances. But only by the merest of cold
nods did Frank and his friends acknowledge the
salute.</p>

<p>“I guess he doesn’t want to be friends,” said
Jerry, a little later. “Well, I guess we can make
out all right without him.”</p>

<p>Being assigned to classes, making out their lecture
schedules and attending to other details,
pretty well occupied the time of the three chums
until late afternoon. And then, having nothing
else to do, they walked down to the lake. Several
of the students were out on it in rowboats, and
there was one motor craft.</p>

<p>“We’ll certainly have to send for the <i>Neboje</i>,”
said Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry. “I’ll write to-day.”</p>

<p>“What do you say to a row,” asked Ned.
“There’s a place where we can hire a boat.”</p>

<p>A man had a concession from the college to let
out boats, though many of the students owned their
own craft, and Ned, Bob and Jerry were soon
sculling over the lake. In one boat they saw Ted
Newton and some friends, and the football captain
nodded in a friendly way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Football practice in an hour,” he called.
“Come over and watch.”</p>

<p>“We will,” promised Jerry.</p>

<p>They rowed some distance down the lake and
went ashore in a wooded tract.</p>

<p>“I wish we’d bought some candy back there at
the boathouse,” remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, chew on some bark,” advised Jerry with
a laugh.</p>

<p>The three boys strolled on through the woods,
until, coming to a little clearing, they heard cries.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sounds like some one shouting for help,” remarked
Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is!” declared Bob. “It’s over
this way. Come on!”</p>

<p>They ran in the direction of the sound, and a
moment later came upon a queer sight.</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass was partly on one side
and partly on the other of a heavy barbed-wire
fence. His clothing was caught in several places
on the sharp points, and it was he who was calling,
while he waved his butterfly net at the boys
to attract their attention.</p>

<p>“Come and get me loose!” he cried.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>IN THE GYMNASIUM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Professor Snodgrass was so entangled between
two strands of the barbed wire that it took
the united efforts of Ned, Bob and Jerry to extricate
him. Even then they did not do it without
tearing his clothes.</p>

<p>“How did it happen, Professor?” asked Jerry.
“Did a bull chase you?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. “I was after a
particularly choice specimen of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanessa milberti</i>,
a butterfly the larva of which feeds upon
the nettle plant. I wished to make some experiments,
and I needed this butterfly. I have never
seen it in this vicinity so late in the season.”</p>

<p>“Did you get it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say I did not.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” Ned interrogated.</p>

<p>“The fence,” replied the professor rather
grimly. “The butterfly, and a beauty it was, was
just beyond the fence. There was no time to climb
it, had I considered myself able to do so. I
reached my arm, with the net, through between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
two wires, and, just as I was going to make the
capture, my foot slipped and I came down on the
barbs. Then, when I tried to get up, those above
me caught in my coat and I was held there. The
butterfly got away, and I was obliged to call for
help. It is fortunate you happened along, for
few students come to these woods, though there
are several interesting plants and trees growing
here, that well repay study.”</p>

<p>“We only happened here by chance,” remarked
Ned.</p>

<p>“Well, I am very glad you did,” replied the
professor. “I am very sorry to have lost that
butterfly,” and he looked around in vain for the
beautiful creature, which is sometimes called Milbert’s
tortoise shell.</p>

<p>“You ought to be sorry you tore your clothes,”
observed Ned.</p>

<p>“Why, so I have!” the professor exclaimed, as
though that had just occurred to him. “Mrs. Gilcuddy
will be sure to say something to me about
it too,” he added. “Well, it can’t be helped,”
and he shrugged his shoulders resignedly.</p>

<p>For a little while the professor roamed about
in the little clearing, looking in vain for more
specimens of butterflies. He found none, but he
captured some bugs which he seemed to prize
highly, though the boys were not much interested.</p>

<p>“You’d better come back in our boat, Professor,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
was Ned’s invitation. “It’s a long walk back
to the college around the shore.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I shall be glad of the water trip.
I can then pin up some of these tears, perhaps,
so Mrs. Gilcuddy will not notice them.”</p>

<p>And that is what Professor Snodgrass tried to
do on the way back in the boat. Using some of the
pins which he carried with him to impale his butterfly
specimens on the stretching boards, as he
sometimes did when afield without waiting to get
back to his laboratory, he endeavored to so conceal
the rents in his garments that the sharp-eyed,
but lovable, housekeeper would not notice them.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry helped by turns, though it
cannot be said that the combined result was very
satisfactory from a sartorial standpoint.</p>

<p>“You can’t notice them very much now; can
you?” asked the professor, turning slowly about
on the dock so the boys could observe him.</p>

<p>“Well, a few show,” said Ned, truthfully
enough.</p>

<p>“I—I think I’ll stay out until it gets dark,” said
the little scientist, who seemed to stand in some
awe of his housekeeper. “Then she won’t see
them, and I can send the suit to the tailor in the
morning.”</p>

<p>“That might be a good idea,” agreed Jerry,
trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>What the outcome of the professor’s accident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was the boys did not learn, as they plunged into a
series of busy times that afternoon and did not
see the little scientist for several days except at the
lectures they had with him in one period.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and watch the football practice,” suggested
Jerry after they had left Mr. Snodgrass
at the dock, repeating his determination to stay
out until darkness had fallen so he might escape
the eyes of his housekeeper.</p>

<p>“That’s a go,” agreed Bob. Ned nodded assent.</p>

<p>The varsity and the scrubs were hard at work
on the gridiron when the three chums reached
the grounds. Ted Newton was working his men
strenuously, while the coaches were first begging
the scrubs to hold the varsity in order to develop a
good offense, and alternating that with fierce demands
for the varsity to rip up the unfortunate
substitutes.</p>

<p>“I sort of wish I was in there,” remarked Jerry,
as he saw the snappy playing. “It’s great.”</p>

<p>“We can go in for it next year,” suggested Bob.
“It’s better to start on baseball in the spring and
get worked up to football.”</p>

<p>“Look at that fellow go!” cried Ned, as one
of the scrubs intercepted a forward pass, and
dashed down the line fifty yards for a touchdown
against the varsity.</p>

<p>“He is a good one,” commented Jerry. “Wonder
what his name is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s Chet Randell,” volunteered a lad standing
near our three friends. “He’ll make the varsity
if he does that trick many times.”</p>

<p>“He deserves to,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Randell,” murmured Bob. “Say, that’s the
fellow who has the room next to mine. I saw his
name on the door.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are you fellows from Borton?” asked their
informant, naming the dormitory in which Ned,
Bob and Jerry roomed.</p>

<p>“That’s us,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Randell’s a beaut drop kicker,” went on the
other, who said his name was Tom Bacon.
“Trouble is though, we’ve got too many kickers
on the varsity. We want more men who can hit
the line, and Chet is a little too light for that.
But if he can smear up many of the varsity’s forward
passes that way he may make the team. Kenwell
Military has the forward pass down fine.”</p>

<p>“Do we play them?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Yes, baseball and football,” answered Tom.
“You’re the new fellows—the motor boys—aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we don’t use that name much any
more,” returned Bob.</p>

<p>“We’ve heard about you,” went on Tom, but
he smiled and did not seem to hold what Jerry
and his chums had done against them, as Frank
Watson did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>When the practice ended and the team and
scrubs came off the field Bob found himself near
the lad who had made the touchdown with the
intercepted forward pass.</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” began the stout lad, “but that
was a beaut play of yours.”</p>

<p>“Glad you liked it,” was the cordial retort.
“Oh, say, I guess I’ve seen you before!” went on
Chet. “You room next to me?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, and these are my friends. We only got
here last night.”</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you,” said the player genially.
“We’ve got a good crowd in Borton, and we’ll
have some swell times when we get going. A
good crowd, yes!”</p>

<p>“All but that Frank Watson and his bunch,”
thought Bob.</p>

<p>They had a glimpse of Frank and his chums on
the football field, but were not near them.</p>

<p>“Can’t you drop in and see us this evening?”
was Jerry’s invitation. “I suppose we can do here
what’s done at other colleges—sneak in a little
feed now and then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it can be did!” laughed Chet. “But
Proc Thornton sure is strict, and he turns up when
least expected. But I’ll have to decline. I’m on
training table you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Jerry. “I’d forgotten
about that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come around to the gym to-night,” suggested
the football player. “We’re going to have a little
practice at the dummy. You fellows look as
though you liked athletics.”</p>

<p>“We do,” admitted Bob. “We’ll be there.”</p>

<p>They had brought their gymnasium suits with
them, as a certain amount of physical culture was
obligatory at Boxwood Hall; and that evening,
when they went to the gymnasium, Bob, Ned and
Jerry were assigned to a certain division, and after
watching the football squad at work, they went
in for their turns.</p>

<p>The strenuous adventures our heroes had gone
through with in the past had given them good
muscles and bodies particularly well adapted for
athletic work. They were not finished performers
in gymnasium work, though, as they very soon
discovered, though they did not lack the nerve,
which is needed in many of the exhibitions on the
parallel bars, the rings, the rope, or the trapeze.</p>

<p>The instructor was showing the boys how to
slide down a rope head first without the use of the
hands, by passing the cable between the thighs
and over the shoulder, under the chin.</p>

<p>“Now you try it,” said the instructor to Frank
Watson, who was in the class with our friends.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not,” said the headstrong youth. “I
strained my leg a little in the pole vault yesterday,
and I don’t want to lame myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll do it!” eagerly exclaimed Jerry, who was
next to Frank in line, though the latter had not
even taken the trouble to bow, much less to speak.</p>

<p>“Very well, Hopkins. Try what you can do.”</p>

<p>Jerry seemed to have caught the knack of it
at once. He came down the rope in fine style,
and was complimented by the director.</p>

<p>“That’s what I like to see!” the coach exclaimed.
“See if any of you can equal that,” and
he glanced in the direction of Frank.</p>

<p>“Trying to show off; aren’t you?” sneered
Frank, as Jerry took his place in line again. “I
thought you fellows would be up to something like
that when I heard about you. We haven’t much
use for such as you motor boys at Boxwood Hall,”
and his voice trailed off into a sneer.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE BANG-UPS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jerry shot a glance at the lad who seemed deliberately
trying to antagonize him. A hot reply
was on the lips of the tall lad, but he held it back.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll give him another chance,” thought
Jerry. “There’s no use in stirring up a row just
because he wants to be nasty.”</p>

<p>Bob and Ned heard what Frank had said, but
no one else appeared to have caught the words,
and Jerry’s two chums wondered why he did not
retort to the unnecessary and unfair remark. But
Jerry explained later.</p>

<p>“Now then, young gentlemen, try the horse,”
ordered the director. “It will be good practice
for you in football and baseball. Lively now!”</p>

<p>The “horse” is a leather-covered affair, resembling
a horse in that it has four legs but not otherwise.
It is a sort of padded sawhorse more than
anything else.</p>

<p>By means of a handle, fixed in about the place
where the saddle would be on a real horse, the athlete
jumps on, over and astride the horse. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the boys in the Boxwood Hall gymnasium proceeded
to do, lining up and taking turns.</p>

<p>In this <a href="#image03">Frank showed considerable ability</a>, while
Jerry was not so good at it, making, in fact, a
rather awkward appearance. And when it came
Bob’s turn there was a real disaster, though a
harmless one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<a id="image03"><img src="images/image03.jpg" width="381" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_106">FRANK SHOWED CONSIDERABLE ABILITY.</a></div>
</div>

<p>The stout lad made a rush for the horse, but
missed getting hold of the handle. He shot over
the horse, slid on the smooth leather padding and
went down on the floor with a bang. He looked
about him with such a comical look on his face
that the instructor and the other boys burst into
laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, Baker, you’re not training for clown-work
in a circus,” remarked the instructor. “Try
it again.”</p>

<p>Bob joined in the laugh, and when he took his
place in the line for another attempt he heard
Frank say sneeringly:</p>

<p>“Well, there are some things the fresh motor
boys can’t do, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out,” advised Bob with a forced
grin. “We don’t claim to be anything like what
you seem to think we are.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get into a row,” advised Jerry in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“If he insults me I—I’ll punch him!” declared
Ned in a whisper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“No you won’t,” contradicted Jerry.</p>

<p>“If he wants to—let him try it!” said Frank,
quickly. “That’s a game I like to play.”</p>

<p>“Silence over there!” called the director,
sharply, while Ned and Frank glared at one another.</p>

<p>Ned made no awkward breaks, so there was no
excuse for Frank’s making any of his slurring remarks,
and the remainder of the gymnasium practice
went off without further incident.</p>

<p>“Say, I wonder what’s got into him?” asked
Bob, as he and his chums were proceeding toward
the dormitory after the practice. “He seems just
to hate us—he and those fellows he goes with.
I wonder why?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t any real excuse,” said Jerry, “but I
imagine it is just as he says. Frank and his chums
are afraid we’ll try to show off, because Professor
Snodgrass told them about our various adventures.
I never thought they’d be held against us.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Ned. “But this Watson is
going to make trouble, I can see that. And the
sooner the better.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“To have it over with. We’ll have to fight
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess not,” said Jerry. “We’ll try and
not roil him.”</p>

<p>“But why should we go out of our way to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
insults, just because this fellow doesn’t like us?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Remember we’re freshmen,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. The other sophs don’t pick
on us the way he and his bunch do. I’m not going
to stand it!”</p>

<p>“Go slow,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>For a week or more after this there were no
open clashes between Frank and his cronies and
our three chums. On occasions, as they passed in
the hall, Frank, Bart and Bill would laugh sneeringly
or pass some slurring remark, but that was
the extent of it. On the other hand Jerry, Bob
and Ned made friends among the other lads in
the various classes.</p>

<p>And right here the point might be emphasized
once more that at Boxwood Hall there was not
the sharp line drawn against freshmen in athletics
and other matters that there is in some of the other
colleges.</p>

<p>It is true that the freshmen were hazed and
not allowed to appear on certain parts of the campus
sacred to the sophomores, juniors and seniors.
And there were some strictly class societies in
which the membership was limited. But there
were also secret organizations which were made
up indiscriminately of members of all four classes.</p>

<p>In athletics, as has been said, there was also no
tight line drawn. In big colleges, of course, freshmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
are not eligible for the varsity, but at Boxwood
Hall, where there was a limited number of
students, in order to increase the available supply
of players the freshmen were drawn upon. Thus
it was that the nine and eleven had freshmen on,
as well as sophomores, juniors and seniors. Nor
were the freshmen obliged to refrain from residence
in dormitories where their “betters” were
housed, though there were some fraternity houses
sacred to certain classes alone.</p>

<p>Football practice went on, and the more our
three friends watched it, the more they wished they
had made themselves fit to be candidates for the
eleven. But it was too late now.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get into it next season though!”
declared Jerry, while Ned and Bob echoed his
words. “It’s great!”</p>

<p>This was on one of the occasions when Boxwood
Hall played an old-time rival and won in a
hard-fought battle. Another time she was not so
successful, and lost to a college she had always
beaten.</p>

<p>“But if we win from the military academy, I
won’t have any regrets,” declared Ted Newton.
“That’s the bunch I want to beat!”</p>

<p>“You’re going to get yours all right to-night,”
was the word passed to Ned, Bob and Jerry one
afternoon, following a lecture on zoology.</p>

<p>“Our what?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hazing,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll take all that’s coming,” said Bob.
“We’ve got to expect it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“And you may get more than you expect,” the
informer went on.</p>

<p>It was rather a rough hazing, for our heroes
were hauled out of their rooms by a crowd of the
sophomores, headed by Frank Watson, and made
to do all sorts of ridiculous things, one of which
was to stand in the public square in Fordham and
eat cream puffs and chocolate eclaires with their
hands tied behind their backs.</p>

<p>Then, in this state, with smeared faces, they
were obliged to appear at a moving picture show,
marching up and down the aisles while the lights
were turned up.</p>

<p>As a climax they were ducked in the campus
fountain basin and then pelted with more or less
over-ripe fruits and vegetables as they were allowed
to return to their rooms.</p>

<p>“Whew!” gasped Bob, “we are some sights.”</p>

<p>They were indeed, their suits being ruined.
But they had taken the precaution to wear old
ones, thanks to the tip.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it’s over,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Ned. “And when our boat
comes we’ll have some good times to make up for
this hazing.”</p>

<p>The <i>Neboje</i> arrived and was launched on Lake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Carmona. The possession of the motor boat
brought new friends to our heroes, and they took
many of their college chums on short cruises, once
remaining out all night because of engine trouble
when they reached the upper end of the lake.</p>

<p>Proctor Thornton had it in mind to punish severely
the luckless ones, but when Jerry explained
matters, and when Professor Snodgrass had put
in a good word for the boys they were excused,
but warned not to take such chances again.</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, don’t you want to join the Bang-Ups?”
asked George Fitch one day of Ned, Bob
and Jerry. This was when George had been taken
out for a motor boat ride.</p>

<p>“The Bang-Ups?” asked Ned. “Is that something
good to eat?”</p>

<p>“It’s a secret fraternal society,” answered
George, looking carefully about to make sure he
was not overheard. “It’s the most exclusive in
the college, but freshmen are eligible when voted
in. I’ll propose you if you like.”</p>

<p>“Sure, we’d like it!” declared Bob.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing, though,” went on George.
“The initiation is a pretty stiff one. Lots of the
fellows get hurt—not badly, of course, but some.”</p>

<p>“You can’t scare us that way,” laughed Jerry.
“We’ve been in some pretty tight places ourselves.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take a chance,” added Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Does Frank Watson and his crowd belong?”
Ned demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“They’ll never vote to let us in.”</p>

<p>“It’ll take more than their votes to keep you
out, though, as a rule, the elections have been
unanimous. But it takes ten black ballots to turn
a candidate down, and at best Frank and his crowd
number nine.”</p>

<p>At the next meeting of the Bang-Ups the names
of our friends were proposed. And Frank Watson,
Bart Haley, Bill Hamilton and several others
opposed them.</p>

<p>But George Fitch, Chet Randell, Lem Ferguson
and, best of all, Ted Newton, the football
captain, championed the cause of our friends to
such advantage that they were elected, only seven
votes against them—not the necessary number.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’d like to have had it unanimous,”
said George, in telling Jerry about the matter afterward.
“But don’t let that worry you, and perhaps
Frank will change his tactics toward you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care much whether he does or not,”
Jerry remarked. “I wish there weren’t any feeling
against us, especially as I know there is no cause
for it, but the Bang-Ups is worth getting into,
even if we didn’t make it unanimously.”</p>

<p>“Glad you think so,” remarked George. “And
now comes the initiation.”</p>

<small>THE INITIATION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Made up, as it was, of members of all four
classes in Boxwood Hall, the Bang-Ups was the
largest secret society in the institution. It had a
fraternity house of its own, not as elaborate as
that of the Bull, the junior society, nor as large
as the Ivy Vine, the exclusive house of the lordly
senior society, but it was a very fine place for all
that.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we’re going to be members,” said
Jerry, talking over their election as they strolled
past the fraternity house one afternoon.</p>

<p>“So am I,” added Bob. “We’ll have a nice place
to spend our evenings.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, too,” remarked Ned, “even though
Frank and his cronies aren’t friendly with us.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ll do at the initiation?”
ventured Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t get nervous,” replied Jerry. “We’ll
live through it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish it were over,” the stout lad went
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be, to-night,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Attendance at one of Professor Snodgrass’s
lectures later that afternoon brought the work of
our three friends to a close for the day, but when
they were leaving the room the little scientist beckoned
to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Have you anything special to do from now
until supper time?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Then could you take me in your auto to Fox
Swamp, near the town of Fairview? It is only
about twenty miles, and if I know anything about
the speed of you boys you can easily do it.”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll take you!” exclaimed Jerry.
“Are you going after a fox?”</p>

<p>“No, that is only a local name for a tract of
land, which isn’t at all swampy, though it used to
be. One of my students, an enthusiastic collector
of butterflies, reported to me that he saw some
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanessa antiopa</i>, sometimes called the Mourning
Cloak, or Camberwell Beauty, over there the other
day. They are the butterflies that have brown
wings, with spots of blue and an outer band of
yellow, but there is a rare variety in which the
yellow band broadens out, and reaches almost to
the middle of the wings. Only two or three such
sports, as they are called, are known; but I hope
I may find one. I have plenty of the ordinary variety
of this butterfly, but I would like to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sport or, as some collectors call them, ‘freaks’ or
‘aberrations.’”</p>

<p>“We’ll be glad to go with you,” Bob told him.
“But I wouldn’t know one butterfly from another.”</p>

<p>“You should take more interest in zoology,”
chided Professor Snodgrass. “Still I cannot complain
of you boys, for you have often helped me
to get some very rare specimens.”</p>

<p>The automobile was brought out of the professor’s
garage, where it was kept, and in it the four
were soon speeding toward Fairview. Fox Swamp
lay beyond the town, and on the way, after passing
through the town, stopping on Bob’s request
for some ice cream, the boys saw a large tract,
with buildings which looked as though it might be
a place where fairs were held.</p>

<p>“That’s what it is,” Professor Snodgrass informed
the boys. “There is a big fair held there
every year, generally toward the end of October.
This year, I understand, there is to be an exhibition
of aeroplanes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take that in,” declared Jerry.</p>

<p>“Here’s the place,” announced the scientist, as
they passed along a road, on either side of which
was a patch of woodland. “Here is where I hope
to find one of the freak <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanessa antiopa</i>.”</p>

<p>“We’ll come with you and help look for it,
but you’ll have to tell us what to look for,” suggested
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, call to me whenever you see any kind
of butterfly,” the professor said, “and I can tell
if it is one that I want.”</p>

<p>Leaving the automobile at the edge of the road,
they went into the swamp, though, as Professor
Snodgrass had said, it was not at all wet. They
scattered, yet keeping within sight of one another,
and then began the search for the butterfly.</p>

<p>At first none was seen, though the professor
managed to get a green bug which he designated
by some long Latin name, and said it was a great
find.</p>

<p>Then Bob, who had gone deeper into the woods
than the others, suddenly called:</p>

<p>“Here you are! Here, Professor! Here’s a
butterfly with big yellow bands on its wings!”</p>

<p>“Watch him! Don’t let him get away! I’ll
be there in a minute!” eagerly cried the little scientist.</p>

<p>“Shall I catch him under my hat?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No! Oh no! Never do that! You would
crush the wings. I must get him in the net. I’m
coming!”</p>

<p>Professor Snodgrass ran toward Bob, who
stood near a bush, intently gazing at some object
on it. With his long-handled net the professor
raced forward. And then something happened.</p>

<p>His foot slipped, the handle of the net caught
on a tree branch, and then went between his legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The result may be imagined. The professor fell
down full length, and there was a cracking sound
when the handle of the net broke.</p>

<p>Ned and Jerry rushed forward to pick up the
unfortunate little scientist, and Bob also turned
away from the bush to lend his aid. But Professor
Snodgrass saw Bob’s action, and raising himself
to his knees, he cried:</p>

<p>“Don’t move, Bob! Don’t stir! Don’t take
your eyes off that butterfly. It’s just what I’ve
been seeking for many years. Watch him! I’m
not hurt. I can get up myself.”</p>

<p>This he did, springing to his feet with the nimbleness
of a boy, and without any aid from Ned
or Jerry.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” asked the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Not a bit. The ground was soft.”</p>

<p>“Your net’s broken,” Ned informed him.</p>

<p>“That’s nothing!” cried Professor Snodgrass
eagerly, as he again ran forward. “It’s only the
handle, and I can fit a new one on. It is long
enough as it is now. Is the Camberwell beauty
there yet, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Professor, but I don’t call it much of a
beauty. There it is—on that branch,” and he
pointed out some object to the scientist.</p>

<p>The latter made a quick movement with his
net, and brought it back to him with a sweeping
motion. Then he eagerly peered within the folds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of the mesh. A disappointed look came over his
face, and he sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the kind you want?” asked Bob.
“It’s yellow.”</p>

<p>“It’s only a yellow leaf,” said the professor,
showing it in his hand.</p>

<p>“All that work for nothing!” cried Jerry.
“Breaking the professor’s net handle, tripping him
up and all, for a yellow leaf. What’s the matter
with your eyes, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—it looked like a butterfly!” insisted
the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the professor soothingly.
“You meant all right, and, for the moment, I myself
was deceived.”</p>

<p>Bob expressed his contrition, and redoubled his
efforts to find what the professor sought, but to
no end. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanessa antiopa</i> seemed to have deserted
Fox Swamp.</p>

<p>“Ah, here’s a butterfly. Sure, this time!” cried
Bob a little later. “I’m not sure it’s the kind you
want, but I know it isn’t a leaf, Professor.”</p>

<p>The scientist hurried to the spot where Bob
stood, and this time there was no accident. But
again came a look of disappointment to the face
of Professor Snodgrass.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a butterfly?” asked Bob. “See, it’s
moving away. Why don’t you get it?” for the
professor did not move his net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s a moth, not a butterfly,” said the scientist,
“and I have enough of that variety.”</p>

<p>“A moth!” exclaimed Ned. “It looked just
like a butterfly.”</p>

<p>“Some moths are hard to distinguish from butterflies,”
the professor went on. “They are quite
different in their habits, however. Butterflies fly
by day, and like the sunshine. Moths, on the other
hand, are night-flying insects, though there are exceptions
to both rules.”</p>

<p>“How can you tell a butterfly from a moth?”
Jerry asked with interest.</p>

<p>“The best way, for an amateur, is to tell by the
antennæ, or feelers. In a butterfly the feelers are
thread-like, and have a small knob, or club, on the
end, and naturalists give them the name <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">rhopalocera</i>,
formed of two Greek nouns, one meaning
a ‘club’ and the other a ‘horn.’</p>

<p>“Moths have all sorts of antennæ, or feelers,
and we naturalists call them <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">heterocera</i>, which is
made up of two Greek words, one meaning ‘all
sorts,’ and the other (keras) a horn, as in the case
of butterflies. So then we have these definitions:
Moths are <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">lepidoptera</i> having <em>all sorts</em> of feelers,
except those that are knob-shaped on the end,
while butterflies are <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">lepidoptera</i> which have <em>only</em>
feelers which end in knobs. Though in some
tropical countries there are moths with feelers
just like those of a butterfly. But I forgot I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
not in the class room,” and Professor Snodgrass
ended his little lecture.</p>

<p>“Go on, we like it!” exclaimed Ned, so while
they were hunting for the rare specimen of the butterfly,
Mr. Snodgrass told the boys more about
the beautiful insects.</p>

<p>“I’ve a good notion to make a collection myself,”
said Jerry.</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” returned the professor.
“Though it is a little late to start this season. Begin
with me next spring.”</p>

<p>“I will,” declared the tall lad.</p>

<p>They had to give up the unavailing search and
return to Boxwood Hall, reaching there just in
time for supper.</p>

<p>“Where have you fellows been?” demanded
George Fitch. “Don’t you know this is the night
you are to be initiated into the Bang-Ups?”</p>

<p>“Sure we know it!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“I thought you had skipped out—afraid of the
ordeal,” said Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” came from Jerry, as he
told the boys where they had been.</p>

<p>“Got your nerve with you?” George demanded.</p>

<p>“Why?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ll need it all right,” was the laughing
response. “The word has gone around and
there’ll be a gladsome crowd to assist you through
the portals and into the inner sanctum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go as far as you like,” said Jerry, with a
laugh. “I think they’re trying to bluff us,” he confided
later to Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>George Fitch escorted Ned, Bob and Jerry to
the fraternity house of the Bang-Ups. They were
admitted to a room, beyond the door of which
could be heard talking and laughter.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be one of us,” George said. “I’ll
leave you now. Better take off your clothes—that
is, all except your underwear, and put on these,”
and he handed the boys bath robes. “There’s
some rough work, and there’s no use spoiling a
good suit.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Jerry, and they proceeded
to invest themselves in the robes.</p>

<p>“Well, I wonder what’s next,” remarked Ned,
as they waited in the room which George had left.
“How long do we stay here?”</p>

<p>The question was answered a moment later, for
the door opened, showing nothing but a vast black
expanse beyond. Then a figure, which seemed to
be a living skeleton, advanced. The three chums
saw at once that the effect was produced by a black
cloak on which had been drawn the outlines of a
skeleton in phosphorous paint.</p>

<p>“Are ye the fearsome candidates?” asked the
figure, in a deep voice.</p>

<p>“Candidates, but not fearsome,” answered
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silence!” came the sharp order. “Answer yea
and nay, but no more.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” responded Jerry.</p>

<p>“Then follow me and we shall see if ye are able
to stand the test of fire, of water, and of death.
If so be ye may prove worthy members of our
ancient and secret order. If not ye shall be cast
into outer darkness. Advance!”</p>

<p>The skeleton figure turned and walked into the
black void. Ned, Bob and Jerry followed, being
able to see only a little way into the room by the
light in the one where they had donned the bath
robes. But, even as they turned, this light went
out, and they were left in total darkness, with
only the phosphorus glow to guide them.</p>

<p>“Follow me!” came in solemn tones from the
skeleton one.</p>

<p>The three walked onward, but there were obstructions
in the way, and though the glowing figure
in front avoided them, our heroes were not
so fortunate. In turn Jerry, Ned and Bob stumbled
over something and went down heavily.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” muttered Ned, rubbing his shins.</p>

<p>“Silence!” came the sharp command. “The
path to the Olympian heights is rough, but ye are
not worthy if ye fall discouraged. Follow on!”</p>

<p>Those had been no gentle falls that had come
to the three chums, but with repressed groans over
aching bones and skinned knuckles and knees they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
went on. The glow in front of them was their
only guide, and, for all they really knew, the skeleton
was their only companion in that dark room.
But Jerry fancied he could hear the breathing of
many, and did not doubt that the room was filled
with students who were taking part in the initiation.</p>

<p>“Be careful, we may fall again,” whispered
Ned. He hoped his voice was not heard, but the
glowing figure again commanded:</p>

<p>“Silence!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than the three initiates,
who were walking together, arm in arm, suddenly
became aware of a void beneath their feet, and
a moment later they felt themselves falling. Then
they plunged into a tank of icy water, sinking
down until it closed over their heads.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>CAUGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry were each good swimmers,
and instinctively they held their breath as they fell
into the water and struck out—but for where they
knew not, for all about them was still as black as
night, and even the phosphorous glow had vanished.</p>

<p>“Cæsar’s aunt!” spluttered Bob, when he could
get his head above water. “What happened?”</p>

<p>“It’s part of the initiation,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Say, but this water’s cold!” came from Ned
shiveringly.</p>

<p>“Silence!” was shouted, and with the word the
lights flashed up and the boys found themselves in
a tank, from which the water was rapidly running,
as they could see by the lowering level. They
looked about them. Standing up on the edge of
the tank stood a figure in pure white, with head
and body covered with a long cloak.</p>

<p>“Come up from the tank and put on these,”
the figure said, indicating some dry underwear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
towels and other robes on chairs at the edge of
the tank.</p>

<p>The lights went out for an instant, and when
they went up again there was no one in the room
but the three chums, and the tank was almost
empty. They were standing on the bottom of it.
They saw some steps which led up out of the tank,
and going up these they changed to dry garments.</p>

<p>Once more the lights went out, and when they
glowed again there stood a figure in red.</p>

<p>“Ye are to be blindfolded, candidates,” came in
deep tones, “and now for the test by blood. Ye
have well withstood the test by water. That by
fire is yet to come.”</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry allowed themselves to be
blindfolded and were once more led forward.
They could tell that lights were glowing in the
room now, for faint gleams came under the blinding
cloths. And there were subdued whisperings,
denoting that there were many in the apartment.</p>

<p>“Hold out your right arms,” came the command.
The boys obeyed. They could feel their
sleeves being pulled up, and a moment later there
was a sharp pain. They could feel that their
skin had been pricked, though only enough to permit
a drop of blood to flow.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried Bob involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Silence!” came the command. “And for that
<em>you</em> must be punctured again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>This time Bob grimly tightened his lips and said
nothing.</p>

<p>The initiates suddenly felt a sensation as though
a sharp knife had been drawn across their arms,
and a voice said:</p>

<p>“Hold a basin. They are flowing well.”</p>

<p>The three chums might have imagined that they
really had been cut, but they knew something of
initiations, and they realized that a piece of ice
drawn over the skin may feel like a knife, while
water dripping into a basin has the same sound as
blood. So they were not at all alarmed.</p>

<p>“They are standing the blood-test well,” said a
solemn voice. “And now for the test by fire.”</p>

<p>“That may not be so nice,” mused Jerry. “I
hope they don’t scorch us too much.”</p>

<p>Blindfolded they were led onward. They could
feel an increase of temperature, and they heard
the roaring of flames.</p>

<p>“Are the irons hot, Keeper of the Sacred Fire?”
a voice asked.</p>

<p>“They are, Most Noble President.”</p>

<p>“’Tis well. Seal the candidates that we may
always know them!”</p>

<p>For an instant Bob, Ned and Jerry shrank back
as they felt hot irons brought near their faces.
There was a tingling sensation, and then a burning
and itching. Jerry knew what had happened.</p>

<p>A warm iron had been brought near them that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
they might feel the heat. Then they were touched
with a piece of ice, and some cow-itch rubbed on
them. Cow-itch is a powder which stings like nettles,
and is painful while it lasts. The more one
rubs it the worse it burns.</p>

<p>“Keep your hands away from it,” advised Jerry
in a low voice to his chums.</p>

<p>“Silence!” came the command.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a voice went on:</p>

<p>“They have been tested by fire, by water and
by blood. So far all is well. Now for the merriment!”</p>

<p>Before the three candidates could move they
were seized and their hands bound behind them.</p>

<p>“Run the course!” came the command, and
they were pushed forward. The chums started off.</p>

<p>“Faster! Faster! Run, don’t crawl!” was
shouted at them, and run they did.</p>

<p>All sorts of things happened to them. They
fell down, and got up. They stumbled and were
buffeted on all sides. Nor were the blows gentle,
some in fact being staggering ones.</p>

<p>That the buffetings were too rough was evidenced
when one of the unseen initiators called out
sharply:</p>

<p>“Here, cut some of that out! We don’t want
to lame ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do as I please!” was the retort, and Jerry
was sure the last speaker was Frank Watson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s taking advantage of us now and making
his blows as hard as possible,” thought Jerry, “but
we won’t squeal.”</p>

<p>Nor did he, while Bob and Ned also bore it all
bravely.</p>

<p>The initiation, while rough, was not unduly
so for a secret society, and the three chums had
been through worse experiences.</p>

<p>Finally, after they had rolled down some sort
of inclined way plentifully sprinkled with bumps,
and had been tossed up in a blanket, they were led
together to some spot, and a voice said:</p>

<p>“’Tis well! Are ye now ready to subscribe to
the sacred rolls, and swear forever to hold inviolate
the secret of our noble order of Bang-Ups?
Answer!”</p>

<p>“We are!” chorused Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>“’Tis well. Loose their bonds and let them
sign the sacred scrolls in their own blood.”</p>

<p>The bonds were loosed, the cloths taken from
their eyes, and the three candidates found themselves
in a big, brilliantly lighted room, while about
them stood their laughing fellow students.</p>

<p>That is, all were smiling save Frank Watson,
Bart Haley and Bill Hamilton, and they looked
sneeringly at our heroes.</p>

<p>“Take the oath and sign in blood,” went on
Harry French, a senior, who was the president of
the society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>A drastic oath was administered, and then pens
were handed the three chums, first having been
dipped in some red fluid, whether blood or not was
not certain. Probably it was not.</p>

<p>“Well, how did you like it?” asked George
Fitch, grinning as he came up to shake hands with
the initiates.</p>

<p>“Oh, it might have been worse,” said Jerry,
philosophically.</p>

<p>“That ducking surprised me,” admitted Bob.</p>

<p>“It generally does,” chuckled the president.
“But get on your clothes, and we’ll have a little
feed.”</p>

<p>A jolly time followed; jolly to Jerry and his
chums from the fact that Frank and his two particular
cronies went away. Afterward our heroes
learned that the initiation had been made unusually
severe, especially the pummeling to which they
were subjected by Frank, Bart and Bill.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we stood it, so what’s the use of
kicking?” remarked Jerry resignedly.</p>

<p>Now full-fledged members of the Bang-Ups, a
name which was well in keeping with the initiatory
process, Bob and his companions found that they
had many more friends, and they began to enjoy
life more fully at Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>The football season was now in full swing, and
several games had been played. Our friends attended,
and “rooted” to the best of their ability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>On many occasions they invited their new
friends to go out in their automobile or in the
motor boat, occasionally taking Professor Snodgrass,
who still kept up a search for bugs, though
butterflies had vanished until the spring.</p>

<p>“Do you know what I think we ought to do?”
said Bob one day, as he stretched out on a couch
in Jerry’s room.</p>

<p>“I can pretty near guess,” ventured Ned, who
was helping Jerry hang up a set of boxing gloves
in artistic fashion, over a pair of crossed foils.
“Hasn’t it something to do with eats, Bob?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but not for me alone, so don’t get fresh.
But lots of the other fellows have feeds in their
rooms, even if it is against the rules, so I don’t see
why we can’t.”</p>

<p>“There’s no good reason,” admitted Jerry.
“What are rules against eats for if not to be
broken? I’m in with you, Bob.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” agreed Ned. “We could have a
swell feed here, as we can use the three rooms
as one.”</p>

<p>“Then let’s do it,” Jerry said. “We’ll leave it
to Bob to buy the grub, and we’ll all chip in. Go
as far as you like, Chunky.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll ask some of the crowd in,” added
Ned.</p>

<p>“Sure,” assented Jerry.</p>

<p>Now midnight lunches, or any other sort, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
the students’ rooms were strictly prohibited at
Boxwood Hall, which made it all the more joyful
to elude “Thorny,” the proctor, and the other
college officials, and have them. Bob smuggled
in the eatables, and the invitations were given, and
one evening several forms might have been observed
quietly making their way to Borton, and
up to the rooms of Bob, Ned and Jerry.</p>

<p>There is no need to describe what took place.
If a boy has never taken part in one he has imagined
them. There were sandwiches galore, pies,
cake, bottles of olives and various tinned dainties.</p>

<p>“Say, this is all to the mustard!” exclaimed Ted
Newton, who had accepted an invitation, in spite
of his football training.</p>

<p>The feasting began. Keyholes had been stuffed
with paper, the windows had been darkened and
every precaution taken. Nevertheless, just as the
feast was about over, there came a knock on the
door.</p>

<p>Ned stood up to switch off the lights. But it
was too late. A key grated in the lock, the door
was suddenly thrown open, and there stood Proctor
Thornton, a grim smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Well, young gentlemen, you seem to be having
a good time,” he said. “You will kindly give me
your names and go to your own rooms. Hopkins,
Baker, Slade—report to me to-morrow morning,
and we will visit Dr. Cole together!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>A COLLISION</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Astonishment and chagrin were plainly written
on the faces of the midnight revelers. The
proctor stood looking at them with a mocking
smile. It had been some time since he had made
such a “haul” as this—captured so many violaters
at once.</p>

<p>For themselves the boys said nothing. There
was nothing they could say. They had been
“caught with the goods,” and there had been so
little warning that none of the food could be slid
under beds or desks—gotten out of the way in
the fashion best adapted to the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Remember, Slade, Baker, Hopkins—report to
me directly after chapel in the morning,” the proctor
went on. “I have the names of the others,
and their cases will be considered separately.
Leave now!”</p>

<p>Ingloriously the guests slunk away, the proctor
watching them go. Then, with a curt nod to Bob,
Ned and Jerry, he left them to clear away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
remains of the feast—though there was not much
uneaten, as may well be imagined.</p>

<p>As the echoes of the proctor’s feet died away
down the corridor, Jerry shut the door and turned
to face his companions.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think of that?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think mighty little of it,” Ned remarked,
sarcastically. “Mighty little.”</p>

<p>“How’d he get in on us so quickly?” Bob demanded,
as he stood with spoon in hand over the
chafing dish containing the second smoking Welsh
rarebit, almost ready to be spread on the toast.
“Wasn’t the door locked?”</p>

<p>“Sure it was!” Jerry answered. “But he opened
it with a key as soon as he knocked. Only for
that we might have had time to get the lights out
and some of the stuff hid.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Ned. “It was tough
luck, all right.”</p>

<p>Puzzling over how their natural enemy had
thus been able to steal such a silent march upon
them, wondering what the outcome would be, and
not a little abashed at the inglorious outcome of
their first entertainment, the three boys cleared
away the remains of the feast and tumbled into
bed.</p>

<p>But with all their troubles their sleep was not
interfered with, and they awoke as usual in the
morning with just a few minutes left in which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
slip, somehow, into their clothes and rush to
chapel, getting in with a number of other latecomers,
just as the doors were closing.</p>

<p>It is to be feared that the minds of Bob, Ned
and Jerry were very little on the devotional exercises
and singing, this state of feeling being shared
by the other culprits, who did not have a very
pleasant prospect before them.</p>

<p>“Wonder what proxy will do to us,” mused
Bob, as, with his two chums, he walked toward
the office of the proctor.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty fierce, I hear,” remarked Ned.</p>

<p>“I like the looks of him,” declared Jerry. “He’s
got a good eye, and he must remember that he
was young once himself.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t take some of ’em long to forget it,”
said Bob. “Well, I guess we can take our medicine.”</p>

<p>The proctor received them gravely, grimly and
with a half smile at their predicament. Beyond a
cool “good-morning!” he said nothing as he accompanied
them to the office of Dr. Cole, a white-haired,
scholarly looking gentleman, the ideal college
president.</p>

<p>Jerry fancied there was a commiserating look on
Dr. Cole’s face as he glanced at the boys. He
must have known what they were there for, and
if he did not the proctor was not slow in giving
the information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hum, yes. More midnight lunches, eh?” said
Dr. Cole musingly. “Yes, you are right, Mr.
Thornton, the practice must be stopped. I am
sorry, young gentlemen, but you know the rules.
You will be deprived of liberty for a week, and
do the usual number of extra lines of Virgil. And
don’t let it happen again.”</p>

<p>Jerry fancied there was a smile under the beard
of the president, but perhaps he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Being deprived of liberty meant that the luckless
ones would not be allowed off the college
grounds, not allowed to go to the village, to go
boating—in short to be prisoners of a sort. And
the writing of the extra Latin lessons was a task
in itself. It was “stiff” punishment, and the boys
realized it. The proctor smiled grimly at them.</p>

<p>“What did you fellows get?” asked Bob of
some of their guests, when they were comparing
notes later in the day.</p>

<p>“Just lines,” answered Chet Randell, meaning
that they had only to write out some extra Latin.
The givers of the feast were thus punished more
than the guests, which perhaps was worked out on
the theory that those who provided the entertainment
had put temptation in the way of others.</p>

<p>“Say, I wonder how he happened to hear about
what we were doing?” asked Bob. “I’m sure no
one saw me smuggle the eats in.”</p>

<p>“And we had everything dark,” added Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I guess Thorny has his own ways of finding
out,” contributed Jerry. “What gets me,
though, is how he happened to have the key to my
room. I thought I had the only one there was,
and it’s a patent lock. An ordinary key wouldn’t
open it. Did he ever do that before when he
busted up a spread—open the door and walk in?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of it,” said Newt Ackerson, a
senior. “He always knocked and demanded admission.
Then there was time to slip the stuff
away and jump into bed.”</p>

<p>“I have an idea how he <em>might</em> have got hold of
a key,” said George Fitch, “and also how he happened
to know all about what was going on.”</p>

<p>“How?” inquired Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, you know Frank Watson used to have
the room where you are, Jerry. He chummed
with Bart Haley and they each had a key.”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with the proctor?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, Frank doesn’t like you fellows any too
well, though why I can’t see for the love of sour
apples. Anyhow, he’s got a grudge against you.
Now what was to hinder him from dropping a
hint to the proctor that there was something doing
in your rooms last night? And, also, what
was to stop Frank from slipping the proc the
extra key so he could get in and catch you with
the goods?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence followed the pronouncement of this ingenious
theory, and then Ned burst out with:</p>

<p>“That’s it! That’s how it happened! The
sneak!”</p>

<p>“Now go a bit easy,” advised Jerry. “I’d want
pretty good proof before I’d believe any fellow
would squeal on another in that way—and slip a
key to the proctor.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe Frank did it,” declared Ned.</p>

<p>“So do I,” concurred George. And while
some expressed their belief to that effect, others
were doubtful. Ned, however, was firm in his
belief that Frank was guilty.</p>

<p>“And I’m going to tell him so to his face, and
offer to punch it for him,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Better be careful,” advised Jerry.</p>

<p>“So had he,” murmured Ned.</p>

<p>The more the three chums thought of what
George had told them, the more they became convinced
(Jerry and Bob, for Ned was already satisfied)
that Frank must have reported them.</p>

<p>“It was a mean trick!” declared Ned. “Keeping
us in bounds for a week!” he continued.</p>

<p>“Well, a week will soon pass, and we did have
a good feed,” returned Bob philosophically.</p>

<p>The idea spread through the college, as such
ideas will, that Frank was the informer, and he
did not take the trouble to deny it. The three
Cresville chums learned more about him than they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
had known before. For one thing, they found
out that Frank was studying zoology under Professor
Snodgrass, though the student confided to
his friends that he fairly hated the study.</p>

<p>“Then what makes him take it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well, it seems his stepfather wanted him to.
Frank is very fond of his stepfather, and does
everything he asks, even to that. He’s quite a different
boy since his mother married again. It
was a good thing for Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he likes somebody, even if it’s
a stepfather,” said Ned.</p>

<p>The punishment week passed, though it was the
longest our three heroes had ever known, and
finally they were restored to liberty.</p>

<p>“And now for a trip on the lake!” exclaimed
Ned. “We’ll make the old <i>Neboje</i> hum!”</p>

<p>“Let’s go down to Simpson’s and have a good
feed!” proposed Bob. “Thorny can’t molest us
there.”</p>

<p>And once again Bob’s chums found no fault
with his proposal to eat. The boys hurried down
to the boathouse, and soon had their craft out on
the sparkling lake, inviting a few of their friends
to go with them.</p>

<p>Simpson’s was another boathouse some miles
from the college, and a recognized students’ rendezvous.
Ned, Bob, Jerry and their guests found
several gay parties gathered at the resort, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
one of the parties was made up of Frank Watson,
Bart Haley and Bill Hamilton.</p>

<p>“There’s the sneak now,” murmured Ned. “I’ve
a good notion to tell him what I think of him.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t,” said Jerry calmly. “Don’t
make a scene.”</p>

<p>As the <i>Neboje</i> was approaching the college
boathouse after the spread Ned, who was steering,
saw the <i>Avis</i>, which was Frank’s boat, also
heading toward the landing place.</p>

<p>“Look out you don’t run into him,” cautioned
Jerry.</p>

<p>“It’s his place to look out,” returned Ned.
“I’m on the right course.”</p>

<p>The motor boats came closer together, and it
was seen that the <i>Avis</i> was headed directly for the
<i>Neboje</i>.</p>

<p>“Look out where you’re going!” cried Bob.</p>

<p>Frank, who was steering, gave no sign that he
heard. He kept on his course.</p>

<p>“Steer out, Ned,” ordered Jerry. “He’s too
headstrong to give in.”</p>

<p>Ned was angry, but not foolish, and he swung
the wheel over. But it was too late. The <i>Avis</i>,
which had not swerved, came swiftly on, and her
sharp bow struck the <i>Neboje</i> squarely amidships,
cutting a deep gash and dangerously careening the
craft of our heroes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>THE AEROPLANE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Look out!” yelled Bob, though why, he could
not have told. It was too late for that advice.</p>

<p>“What do you mean—running us down?” fiercely
demanded Ned.</p>

<p>The <i>Neboje</i>, after heeling well over, swung
back, and slowly came to an even keel, while the
<i>Avis</i>, under a reversed engine, backed away.</p>

<p>“You did that on purpose!” cried Ned, shaking
his fist at Frank, who did not seem at all put out
by the accident. “You don’t know any more about
steering a boat than a cow!” went on Ned. “You
did this deliberately, and you’ll pay for it, too.”</p>

<p>“You got in my way,” said Frank coolly. “You
saw the course I was steering. I had a right to it.
You should have gone to port.”</p>

<p>“That’s how little you know about boating,”
said Jerry as calmly as he could under the circumstances.
“It was you who should have steered
over.”</p>

<p>Frank did not reply to this, but again started
his boat for the landing place. Ned, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
shut off the engine when he saw that a collision
was inevitable, started it again, and went on to
the place where the <i>Neboje</i> was usually moored.</p>

<p>“You’d better take some steering lessons,”
shouted Ned after Frank. “But then it’s what I’d
expect of a fellow who would squeal on others
about a feed, and hand the proc the key to the
room.”</p>

<p>“Who says I did that?” cried Frank, leaping
out of his boat and running to where Ned stood
on the dock.</p>

<p>“I do!” answered Ned truculently, “and I’m
ready to back it up!” He began taking off his
coat, an example followed by Frank.</p>

<p>“You can’t fight here,” said Ted Newton, stepping
in between the angry youths. “If you want
to have it out, do it regularly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do it!” cried Ned.</p>

<p>“And you’ll find me there!” added Frank with
a sneer. “I’ll make you take back what you said.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll make you pay for damaging our
boat!” retorted Ned.</p>

<p>The details of the fight that followed in the
secluded place appointed by college custom for
such affairs may be passed over. Suffice it to say
that Ned and Frank were evenly matched, and
each received about the same amount of punishment—black
eyes being administered to both, with
various cuts and bruises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>And the fight did not settle either point. Ned
refused to take back what he had said to Frank
about the key. Nor would Frank pay for the
damage to the <i>Neboje</i>, though the damage was
not as great as had originally been feared.</p>

<p>So matters stood about where they were at first,
with this exception, that there was more bad
blood between our heroes and Frank and his
chums.</p>

<p>But in spite of this Ned, Bob and Jerry were
finding life at Boxwood Hall very much to their
liking. It is true they had enemies, principally
those of Frank’s set, and they had rivals, as might
be expected. But they also made many friends.
What boys would not who were as manly and as
jolly as the Cresville chums, and who had, moreover,
a fine car and a motor boat? The latter
had been repaired and many a jolly trip our
friends had in her.</p>

<p>They also went on outings in the machine, Professor
Snodgrass going along occasionally, to look
for late fall insects. One day the little scientist,
learning that Bob, Ned, Jerry and Tom Bacon
were going in the direction of Fox Swamp, mentioned
the fact that he wanted to go there also,
to see if he could not find a certain species of very
large beetle, which, at this time of the year, burrowed
into the ground, there to remain until warm
weather came again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come along,” said Jerry, who was at the
wheel; and they were soon speeding in the direction
of Fairview.</p>

<p>“This is some way to come to college!” exclaimed
Tom, enthusiastically. “A motor boat
and a car would make college worth while to anyone.”</p>

<p>“And Boxwood Hall is a dandy place!” exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>As they passed the fair grounds, scenes of activity
were noted.</p>

<p>“Looks as though something was going on,”
remarked Bob.</p>

<p>“There is,” said Tom. “The fair opens to-morrow,
and there’s going to be an aeroplane
flight. I’m coming over.”</p>

<p>The other boys expressed their intention of doing
the same. On their arrival at the swamp Professor
Snodgrass enlisted the aid of the lads in
looking for the large beetle.</p>

<p>“If you see some round holes in the ground,
with a little heap of earth on two sides of it, you
may know the beetle is there,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why <em>two</em> heaps of earth?” asked Ned.
“There is only one when ants dig out their chambers
under ground.”</p>

<p>“That is one of the peculiarities of this beetle,”
said the little scientist, as he mentioned the Latin
name. “It burrows into the ground, and brings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
up the excavated earth, putting it in two almost
exactly even piles. Just why, we have never been
able to learn.”</p>

<p>The boys scattered, to look for beetle holes,
for they liked the professor and were always glad
to help him in his scientific work, especially when
it was of an odd turn, such as this.</p>

<p>“Here’s a hole—I’ve found one!” cried Ned,
and Professor Snodgrass, hurrying over, confirmed
the discovery.</p>

<p>“The beetle is working down there now,” he
said. “You can tell that by the freshness of the
piles of earth.” The boys saw that there were
two little earth-piles, just as the scientist had said.
Professor Snodgrass knelt down over the hole.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Jerry asked.</p>

<p>“Get the beetle,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The professor inserted his two fingers in the
opening, and began feeling about. Suddenly a
queer look came over his face, and he uttered an
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Did you get the beetle?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Er—yes, I—I think so,” was the hesitating
answer. “Or perhaps it would be more correct
to say that the beetle has <em>me</em>. My! how he
pinches!”</p>

<p>The professor pulled up his fingers, and clinging
to one of them was a large, black beetle, which
had drawn blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look at that, would you!” cried Bob. “I
wouldn’t want one of them to get on me.”</p>

<p>“They <em>have</em> rather powerful mandibles,” admitted
the professor. “If one of you will hand
me my cyanide bottle I’ll get rid of this fellow.”</p>

<p>Jerry handed over a large-mouthed bottle which
the scientist had placed with his specimen box a
little distance from him. The bottom of the flask
was filled with plaster of Paris, in which was
mixed cyanide of potassium. This gives off a
very poisonous gas. Insects dropped into the bottle
die painlessly. The professor held the beetle,
still clinging to his finger, down inside the bottle,
and in a few seconds the queer, burrowing insect
dropped to the bottom of the bottle, which the
professor corked.</p>

<p>“A very successful capture,” he remarked.
“Now for another.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you are going to put
your fingers down another hole and run the chance
of getting bitten?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mind a little bite like this,” said
Professor Snodgrass, putting some peroxide on
the punctures. “I must have another beetle.”</p>

<p>“And he got it, too!” said Jerry, telling about
the incident afterward, “or rather, the beetle got
him again, on another finger.”</p>

<p>The professor was enthusiastic over his specimens,
even though the bites poisoned him so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
his fingers swelled up, and he could not write for
a week. But he said it was worth all the pain.</p>

<p>“Well, shall we take in the fair?” asked Jerry
of his chums the next day after lunch.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” cried Ned. “I want to see if they
have anything new in aeroplanes.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have to go some to beat the motor
ship we had,” observed Bob. “But we’ll have
some fun, anyhow. Let’s make up a crowd and
go in the machine.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and with Tom Bacon,
George Fitch, Ted Newton and Chet Randell, the
boys set off for Fairview that afternoon, “cutting”
some lectures in order to make the trip.</p>

<p>The fair grounds were a lively place, for tents
and booths had been put up over night, and, gaily
decorated with flags and bunting, made a pleasing
picture that bright October day.</p>

<p>“There’s the aeroplane over there!” cried Ned,
as they went to the parking place with their automobile.</p>

<p>“Two of ’em!” added Bob. “They’re just the
ordinary type, though. Nothing like what we
had.”</p>

<p>“Did you fellows really have an aeroplane?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure we did!” answered Jerry.</p>

<p>“These have self-starters,” remarked Ned, as
he and the others inspected the aeroplanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“And they carry double,” added Bob.</p>

<p>There was a big crowd around the air craft,
for it had been announced that a race was about
to take place. Jerry and his chums saw Frank
Watson and his crowd near the biplanes, and
Frank, looking at our heroes, said sneeringly, and
loudly enough to be heard by them:</p>

<p>“This is the kind of machine the motor boys
said they had. Humph! I don’t believe they’d
dare go up in a balloon!”</p>

<p>“The cad!” muttered Ned. “I’ll show him!”</p>

<p>“Now quiet down,” ordered Jerry. “If you
don’t——”</p>

<p>At that moment one of the aviators stepped
forward and addressed the throng.</p>

<p>“Is there any one here who has been up in an
aeroplane, and who is willing to go up again?”
the man asked. “My partner has failed to arrive,
and we can’t have the race unless I take some one
up with me. Will any one volunteer?”</p>

<p>Ned Slade stepped forward.</p>

<p>The aviator looked over the crowd, at first
not appearing to have seen Ned. Then the lad
spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up with you,” he said, “if you think I’m
the right weight to balance properly. If not my
two friends here——” and he motioned to Jerry
and Bob.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about aeroplanes?”
asked the man.</p>

<p>“A little,” admitted Ned, modestly.</p>

<p>“Have you ever been up in one?”</p>

<p>“More than once.”</p>

<p>“It’s all a bluff!” sneered Frank from where
he stood. “He daren’t go up in that machine.”</p>

<p>“You—you——” began Ned angrily, and then
his better sense made him keep silent.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you up in a minute if you’ve had any
experience at all, and aren’t afraid,” said the aviator.</p>

<p>“Afraid!” laughed Ned. Then he mentioned
some of the meets he and his chums had attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and taken part in, winning some races. Bob and
Jerry confirmed this.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you were at <em>those</em> meets you sure are
an old hand at the game!” said Mr. Perdy, the
aviator. “I was at one myself, but I don’t recall
you. Yes indeed, Slade, I’ll take you up and glad
to do it. Without a partner I can’t pull off this
race, as one of the conditions is that each machine
shall carry two persons. In fact, they won’t balance
well without a double load, though I have
gone up with a bag of sand.”</p>

<p>“Are you going high?” asked Ned. “Will I
need a heavier coat?” for as all know, it is very
cold in the upper air currents.</p>

<p>“We’re not going high, not more than a mile
or two,” was the reply. “But I can get you my
partner’s big ulster. I can’t imagine why he isn’t
on hand. His train must be late. However,
you’ll do very nicely. Do you know how to steer,
and manage the engine—well, if anything happens?”
he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Ned nodded, and a helper ran off to get the
overcoat and a cap for the young aviator.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d volunteered,” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Same here,” murmured Jerry. “It would be
like old times to be in the clouds. Next year we’ll
bring our aeroplane here.”</p>

<p>The other students, as well as the crowd in
general, were looking curiously at Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“He sure has got nerve,” declared Ted Newton.</p>

<p>“He’ll back out at the last minute,” sneered
Frank.</p>

<p>Ned heard but did not answer.</p>

<p>The two aviators who were to go up in the
other machine had been getting it ready. It was
now wheeled to the starting line with the one in
which Ned and Mr. Perdy were to make the ascent.
Ned got into the big ulster and drew the
cap down over his head. He took his place in
the seat beside Mr. Perdy and waved his hand to
his chums.</p>

<p>“See you later, boys,” he called, as though starting
off in an automobile.</p>

<p>“He’s really going up!”</p>

<p>“Say, that’s nerve all right!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think he’d do it!”</p>

<p>“I wonder what Frank Watson thinks now.”</p>

<p>These were some of the remarks from the
crowd.</p>

<p>“So, it wasn’t a bluff after all; was it, Jerry?”
asked Ted Newton.</p>

<p>“Of course not. I told you we’d gone up many
times before. I’ll bring our motor ship here next
season, and prove that we have one.”</p>

<p>“That will be great! It’s almost as good as
football.”</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Mr. Perdy of Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure. Any time you are. Let her go!”</p>

<p>“I thought you said he’d back out, Frank,” observed
Bart Haley to his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, he may yet. I don’t count much on the
spunk of those fellows who call themselves motor
boys,” and there was a sneer in Frank’s voice.</p>

<p>The other aviator and his partner announced
that they were ready. They took their places,
and a moment later, when the judges gave the
signal, the switches of the self-starters were
thrown over and with a rattle and bang the motors
began to revolve the propellers.</p>

<p>Rapidly the big wooden blades spun around
until they had speed enough to move the aeroplanes
over the smooth ground. Then, like two
big birds, the craft left the earth together, sailing
upward on a long slant.</p>

<p>“Ever do the spiral?” yelled Mr. Perdy into
Ned’s ear.</p>

<p>He nodded in affirmation.</p>

<p>“I’ll try it going up,” went on the aviator and
he began climbing toward the clouds in corkscrew
fashion.</p>

<p>Down below the crowd was shouting and cheering,
for some of them had never seen an aeroplane
before. But to many of the students of Boxwood
Hall the machines were not new, though to
have one of their fellow-members ascend in one
was something out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish I had nerve enough to do that!” exclaimed
Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>“Same here,” murmured Chet Randell. “It
must be great.”</p>

<p>“I was a bit scared at first,” confessed Bob.
“But I soon got used to it.”</p>

<p>“And he had as good an appetite up in the air
as he did on the ground!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, quit!” begged the stout lad.</p>

<p>“Did you really eat on your aeroplane,
Chunky?” asked George Fitch.</p>

<p>“Eat? Say, we couldn’t live on <em>air</em> you know,”
answered Chunky.</p>

<p>“Our biggest craft was a combined dirigible
balloon and aeroplane,” Jerry explained. “We
went on long trips in it, and were off the earth
for days at a time.”</p>

<p>“Say, that sure was great!” cried Tom.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all eyes were on the two aeroplanes,
which were becoming smaller and smaller
the higher up they went towards the clouds.</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t back out; did he?” asked some
one of Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” was the snarled answer.</p>

<p>“He took to it like a duck to water,” observed
Tom Bacon, speaking of Ned. “I wonder if
he’ll win the race.”</p>

<p>“He’s won ’em before,” put in Jerry, “but he’s
not running the machine now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The race was going on in the air, but as previous
books concerning the motor boys have so
fully gone into the subject of aeronautics, the details
of the race will not be set down here, for it
was an ordinary one as compared to some in which
Ned, Bob and Jerry had taken part. Suffice it to
say, that after circling around several times over
the fair grounds, keeping outside the pylons, as
the upright posts marking the course were called,
the two air craft made ready for the finish.</p>

<p>So far, it had been a pretty even contest, but
when the time came for the last round and the
descent, Mr. Perdy yelled to Ned:</p>

<p>“I’m going to try to beat him. I think I can
strike a better current of air down below, where
there is less resistance.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” Ned assented.</p>

<p>Instantly the aeroplane shot downward, and
then, checking it, the pilot sent it forward. A
glance upward showed that he had gained a little
on his rivals.</p>

<p>“Take the wheel and bring her down,” suggested
Mr. Perdy; and Ned did, the guiding apparatus
being made so that it could be shifted
from one side to the other.</p>

<p>Swift as a bird Ned sent the craft downward.
He was approaching the finish line.</p>

<p>“We’re going to beat!” he told himself.</p>

<p>He was now near the earth, and to check his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
sudden descent he threw up the rudder a little, to
cause the down-shooting craft to rise. This acted
as a brake.</p>

<p>A moment later Ned let his craft down, and it
ran along on the wheels over the finish line, several
lengths in advance of the other.</p>

<p>“Ned Slade wins!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for him!”</p>

<p>“Hurrah for Boxwood Hall!”</p>

<p>“Ned did it!”</p>

<p>Of course Mr. Perdy would have won had he
been steering, but he chose to let the honor come
to Ned, and the lad appreciated it.</p>

<p>“Great work, old man!”</p>

<p>“That was clever!”</p>

<p>“You sure have nerve!”</p>

<p>Thus cried Ned’s chums as they crowded
around him, clapping him on the back and seeking
to shake hands. He was overwhelmed with congratulations.</p>

<p>“That was fine!” said Mr. Perdy. “You sure
do know aeroplanes! You’re not open for an engagement,
are you? I have several dates booked
for the South this winter, and if my partner isn’t
going to attend to business any better than he did
to-day, I’d like to make some arrangements with
you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I’m going to stay at Boxwood
Hall,” answered Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Jerry and Bob, joining Ned, looked over to
where Frank Watson had been standing. But
he was gone.</p>

<p>“I guess he had enough,” observed Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>The other attractions at the fair did not interest
the college lads very much, and as there were
to be no more flights that day the crowd of boys,
including our friends and those who had come in
the automobile with them, made their way back,
stopping in Fordham at the “Band-Box” for some
soda-water and other like refreshments. Little
else was talked of but Ned’s flight.</p>

<p>“I never knew it could be so easy,” said Lem
Ferguson.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to get used to it, of course,” Ned
remarked. “Otherwise, there’s nothing to it.”</p>

<p>“I guess Frank will keep his mouth closed after
this,” observed Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t worry me,” announced Ned.</p>

<p>Cold weather was approaching. The mornings
were chilly and the nights chillier. It was November,
and football had the call. The Boxwood
Hall team was doing well, and preparing for the
annual contest with the military academy.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to win, too!” declared Ted
Newton.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>Bart Haley was one of the star halfbacks on
the eleven, but there was a danger that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
fall below the standard in studies, and not be allowed
by the faculty to take part in the annual
Thanksgiving day contest with Kenwell. This
would be a big loss to Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>As the time for the big contest approached, the
standing of Bart became so uncertain that his
companions, and especially Ted Newton, were
worried.</p>

<p>“I can make it all right,” announced Bart one
night to a group of boys, our three heroes being
among the crowd. “I can make it all right if I
don’t flunk in chemistry to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re not going to flunk!” cried the
football captain. “We’ll coach you now, and
coach you good and hard.”</p>

<p>Thereupon those who were well up in that subject
began to try to hammer into Bart’s brains the
needful knowledge that would insure him a passing
mark in the chemistry tests which would take
place the next day. It was a rather important examination,
and if Bart failed to make the required
average in it he would not be eligible for the
eleven, and could not play against Kenwell.</p>

<p>“And we need him,” said Ted.</p>

<p>But Bart’s worst study was chemistry. He
simply could not remember the different symbols,
try as his friends did to drill them into his head.
They worked far into the night with him, but in
the morning, Bart met Jerry, with whom, of late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he had become much more friendly than was
Frank with any of our three heroes.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Jerry,” said Bart, perhaps more
chummy because of his trouble than otherwise he
would have been. “I know I’m going to flunk in
chemistry.”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t!” Jerry insisted.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it. I can’t tell now whether
H₂SO₄ is oxylic acid or oxygen.”</p>

<p>“It’s neither,” said the tall lad. “It’s sulphuric.”</p>

<p>Bart groaned.</p>

<p>“That’s the way it is,” he said.</p>

<p>“Look here!” cried Jerry, suddenly. “We want
to win that game, and the team depends on you.
If the examination could be postponed you
wouldn’t have to take it until after Thanksgiving.”</p>

<p>“And then I wouldn’t care half as much if I
flunked,” said Bart, “for this is the last and most
important game of the year. But they won’t put
off the exam.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’ll have to,” said Jerry, mysteriously.
“I might persuade them.”</p>

<p>“How can you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” and Jerry and Bart went off to
a secluded place together, much to the wonderment
of Frank, who could not imagine why his
crony had suddenly become so chummy with one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the boys whom Frank and his chums had voted
to snub.</p>

<p>But if poverty makes strange bedfellows, the
desire to win a football game may make a fellow
forget a contract he has entered into, especially
when such an agreement is not altogether in good
taste. Bart was beginning to like Jerry in spite
of the efforts Frank made to prevent this. And
when Jerry made his proposition, Bart cried:</p>

<p>“Say, if you can do that I’ll be your friend for
life! If we can postpone the examination I’ll be
all right, for I’m just at passing mark now. But
if I flunked in chemistry I wouldn’t be.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me,” said Jerry. “What time is
the exam?”</p>

<p>“Two this afternoon, and I’m going to spend
every second from now to then boning away.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t,” Jerry assured him. “There
won’t be a chemistry test to-day.”</p>

<p>And there was not. When the class assembled
in the room to wait for Professor Baldwin to
come in to give the examination, they waited a
long time. No professor appeared, though usually
he was very prompt. Some of the boys looked
wonderingly at one another, but they were on an
honor system, and had promised not to speak
after entering the examination room. They kept
their word.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and no chemistry professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
appeared to conduct the test. As it was partly
oral, his presence was needed.</p>

<p>Finally, Proctor Thornton, who made it his
business to visit each class room, some time during
the progress of an examination, entered the room.
He looked in surprise at the seated students in
the semi-darkness, and he noted the absence of
Professor Baldwin.</p>

<p>“Where is the dean?” asked the proctor.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t been here, sir,” answered Jake
Porter.</p>

<p>“This is very strange. Wait here a moment,
and I will inquire.”</p>

<p>The proctor was gone a short time, during
which the hopes of Bart and his friends rose high.
There was hardly time for an examination now,
and to-morrow would be a holiday.</p>

<p>The proctor came back.</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, young gentlemen,” he said,
“but Professor Baldwin is not to be found. The
examination is postponed. You may go.”</p>

<p>And not even the proctor’s presence could restrain
the cheer that echoed through the room.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, Bart!” cried his friends, as they hurried
out. “You play against Kenwell to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I guess I do,” admitted Bart with a grin.</p>

<p>“But what happened to Baldy?” asked several.</p>

<p>Bart slowly winked his eye.</p>

<p>“Ask Jerry Hopkins,” he replied.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<small>THE BOXWOOD PICTURE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But there was no need to ask Jerry what had
happened to the chemistry professor. Soon after
the relieved youths poured out of the examination
room they observed, coming along the street and
stopping in front of the house of Professor Snodgrass,
an automobile containing that little scientist,
Professor Baldwin and Jerry himself.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed Professor Snodgrass,
looking at his watch, “we have been gone a long
time. I had no idea it was so late, and I had some
research work I wanted to do.”</p>

<p>Something seemed to strike Professor Baldwin
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Late!” he exclaimed, also looking at his watch.
“So it is late. I had—let me see—I had something
special on for this afternoon. Where is my
memorandum book?”</p>

<p>He consulted it, and a look of consternation
came over his face.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” he cried. “I was to have conducted
a chemistry examination this afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
but I forgot all about it. Pshaw! How forgetful
I am becoming! It is too late, now, though,” he
added with a sigh. “Too late!”</p>

<p>Jerry Hopkins smiled, and had it not been so
near dusk Bart and some of the others would have
seen him winking at them.</p>

<p>“How ever did you manage it?” asked Bart,
becoming exceedingly friendly with Jerry all of
a sudden. “Did you kidnap Baldy?”</p>

<p>“Well, you <em>might</em> call it that,” admitted Jerry.
“But he himself helped some. This is the way it
was. I knew you had to play on the team, and
you told me you would surely flunk in chemistry.
So I argued that the only way to do was to have
the exam postponed.</p>

<p>“Now, if there is one professor here that is as
absent-minded and forgetful as Professor Snodgrass,
it is the dean. And I happened to know
something else about them. They hold radically
different views on fossil shell formations. In fact,
they come about as near to quarreling on that
subject as two such delightful old gentlemen ever
do come. So I knew if I could get them started
on a discussion about fossils they might keep it
up and the dean forget all about the passage of
time. I also knew that I had to get the dean away
from the college, or, even in the midst of a hot discussion,
something might break in on it to remind
him of the exam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I happened to know where there was a
bed of fossils over near Fox Swamp. So I got a
few specimens, and took them to Professor Snodgrass,
pretending to be puzzled on a point concerning
them. I mildly differed with him in some
of his statements, and said that Professor Baldwin
held different views, which, by the way, he
did. He wouldn’t agree with Professor Snodgrass
in a thousand years, so I knew I was safe.</p>

<p>“I pretended to be very much interested and
puzzled, and I suggested that it would be a good
thing if Professor Snodgrass and Professor Baldwin
would accompany me to Fox Swamp, where
we could go into the matter more thoroughly.”</p>

<p>Jerry paused to chuckle.</p>

<p>“Go on,” urged Bart. “What happened?”</p>

<p>“Well, they fell into the trap as easily as
Chunky here can eat pie. I brought around the
machine, got them in and off we went for the
swamp. When I got them to the fossil bed, wild
horses couldn’t have pulled them away, for I’d
unearthed some new specimens. And then the
fun began. The two professors went at each
other with pet theories for weapons, and pointed
out minute indications in geology that I had never
dreamed of. I was completely out of it, so I
wandered off in the woods and waited for them
to finish.</p>

<p>“I guess they would have been at it yet, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
they dug up a queer kind of rock that stumped
them both to tell what it was, and they yelled for
me to hurry with them back to the college so they
could look it up in the dictionary—or whatever
book they use for such things.</p>

<p>“And there you are, boys. We just got back,
and it’s up to you chaps to provide some amusement
for me in return for listening to a lot of dry
rock-talk all afternoon, besides losing my fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll take care of you all right!” laughed
Bart. “That sure was one dandy little trick! It
worked like a charm. Shake!”</p>

<p>Bart and Jerry clasped hands in a most friendly
fashion, to the no small disgust of Frank.</p>

<p>“Great work, Jerry!”</p>

<p>“This will go down in college history!”</p>

<p>“The best ever!”</p>

<p>Thus Jerry’s chums congratulated him.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t let it get out—I mean my part in
it!” begged Jerry. “I’d be jugged if it were
known.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll keep it dark,” promised Bart. “The
faculty will never know.”</p>

<p>It is hard to say whether this state of affairs
existed long, but one is inclined to think that
some, at least the proctor, must have suspected.
But he could do nothing, for Professor Baldwin
had remained away of his own accord. And he
was the dean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, why do you want to get so thick with that
Jerry Hopkins?” asked Frank of Bart that evening.</p>

<p>“Because he did me a big favor. I’d never have
been able to play in the game to-morrow if he
hadn’t held that exam off the way he did.”</p>

<p>“Um,” was all Frank said.</p>

<p>That Thanksgiving Day game with Kenwell
was a good one, though at first, when the military
lads rolled up two touchdowns and a goal against
Boxwood Hall, it looked black for the latter.
And then Bart cut loose, and in each of the second,
third and fourth quarters made a touchdown,
while another was scored on a forward pass, and
thus Boxwood Hall humbled her ancient enemy.</p>

<p>“That’s the way!”</p>

<p>“Whoop her up!”</p>

<p>“We’ve beat ’em, boys!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Bart Haley!”</p>

<p>They were given riotously.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Jerry Hopkins!”</p>

<p>There was no apparent reason why they should
be given, for Jerry was not on the team.</p>

<p>But they were given with resounding echoes,
for the story of how Jerry had saved Bart to the
team was all over the school by then. Only one
lad refrained from joining in the cheers for Jerry,
and he was Frank Watson.</p>

<p>“Oh, forget your grouch,” suggested Bill Hamilton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“Jerry and his chums aren’t such bad fellows,
Frank.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got my own opinion,” was the answer of
the headstrong lad.</p>

<p>There was a great celebration that night over
the football victory, and if there were midnight
lunches, Proctor Thornton did not surprise any
of the feasters. Perhaps he purposely kept away.</p>

<p>Life went on at Boxwood Hall. It became too
cold for motor boating, and the <i>Neboje</i> was
hauled out, for the lake would soon be frozen
over. But the automobile was kept in use.</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays came, bringing a vacation
which enabled the motor boys to go home,
where they had glorious times.</p>

<p>It was a week after their return to Boxwood
Hall, and the new year’s schedule of lessons was
under way. President Cole, on the reassembling
of the college classes, had made a plea for harder
mental work, and most of the boys were buckling
down to their lessons, at least for a time.</p>

<p>Bob, Ned and Jerry were sitting in their rooms,
or rather, in Jerry’s room, one evening, studying.
Finally Jerry flung his book away from him, upsetting
a tumbler of water over Bob, who yelled
out:</p>

<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>“It means I’ve just thought of something,” said
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I wish you’d keep such thoughts to yourself,”
grumbled the stout lad, as he sopped up the
water.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“This,” replied Jerry. “Things have been too
slow around here of late. Everything has a flat
taste. We are getting into a rut. No one has
brought a cow, or even a goat, into a class room.”</p>

<p>“I was a goat in French to-day,” declared Ned.
“I couldn’t get a single verb right. But go on.”</p>

<p>“Merely this,” said Jerry. “Let’s do something.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“You know the Boxwood picture that hangs
in chapel; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“That big oil portrait of Ebenezer Boxwood,
founder of the college?” Ned inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Jerry. “That’s the sacred cow
I refer to. Now what is the reason we can’t take
that picture and hang it where all who wish may
admire it? Say hoist it up on the flagpole, where
it can be seen. It hangs in such a dark corner in
chapel that the full beauties of it are not brought
out. On the flagpole they could be seen.”</p>

<p>“You mean to hang the sacred Boxwood Hall
picture on the pole?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I do,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“Who’ll do it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“We will,” said Jerry, calmly.</p>

<small>“WHO TOLD?”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For a moment Bob and Ned gazed silently at
their tall chum. Then they spoke.</p>

<p>“Take the Boxwood picture?” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“And put it on the flagpole?” added Bob.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Jerry. “Worse, or better,
jokes, as you choose to call them, have been perpetrated
here. It beats taking a goat up to a class
room, or taking the knob off a prof’s door so he
can’t get out to make you flunk.”</p>

<p>“But it doesn’t beat taking two of the highbrows
off and making them forget to come back,”
chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” admitted Jerry, with a smile.
“That was some little trick, if I do say it myself.”</p>

<p>“It sure was!” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>“But about this picture,” went on the tall lad.
“Are you going to help me get it, or not?”</p>

<p>“Just us three?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Jerry. “The more you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
have in a game like that, the more danger there
is in getting found out. We three can do it alone.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Bob, smiling. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” added Ned. “But how are we
going to do it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have it all planned,” Jerry told his
chums. “We’ll wait until it gets a little later,
and then we’ll go into chapel by the little side door
near Martin’s house.” (Martin was the janitor
who looked after chapel.) “He hardly ever locks
the door,” went on Jerry, “but if he does I have
some extra keys that I think will work. We can
sneak in there, take the picture off the wall, slip
around back of the gym and up to the flagpole.
No one goes there at night. The flag will be
down, and the halyards will be in the little box on
the pole. That isn’t locked. All we’ll have to
do will be to fasten the picture to the ropes and
hoist it up, fasten the ropes and get back to our
own little beds. Of course, we’re taking a chance
in being out of the dormitory after hours, but
that’s done every night, and at worst it means
only some extra lines.”</p>

<p>“But if we’re caught out, and they find the picture
up on the pole in the morning, won’t they
suspect us?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose we’ll be the <em>only</em> ones out
to-night; do you?” asked Jerry. “They won’t
suspect us any more than they will any one else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s taking a risk,” objected Bob.</p>

<p>“Of course it is!” admitted his tall chum.
“What would be the fun if there were no risk?”</p>

<p>“We shan’t damage the picture any; shall we?”
Ned demanded.</p>

<p>“Not a scratch, if we can help it,” promised
Jerry. “We’ll just hoist it up and leave it where
a good view can be had of it. Are you game?”</p>

<p>Again Bob and Ned said they were. They were
mildly excited, too. As Jerry had stated, matters
had been a bit dull at Boxwood Hall of late.
Nothing of interest had been done, save that a few
of the old-time jokes—“standardized plays”—Jerry
called them, had been executed. The boys
welcomed any sort of change.</p>

<p>Jerry went carefully over all the details with
his chums.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to work quickly,” he told them.
“And I’ll lay out the work so each one of us will
have just certain things to do. And do ’em fast—that’s
the word—fast!”</p>

<p>The boys waited until it was near the hour
when lights must be extinguished and every student,
who had not permission to remain out, must
be in his room. Then, with a final word of instruction,
Jerry led his chums forth. As he left
his room he took up a black robe they sometimes
used in the automobile when it was chilly.</p>

<p>“What’s that for?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>“To throw over the picture. The gold frame
might shine when we passed some lamp and give
the game away. I’ll cover it with this robe.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Carefully and cautiously the three chums made
their way to the chapel. It stood well away from
the other college buildings. The only structure
near it was the cottage of Martin, the janitor, an
elderly man fond of a pipe and a book after supper,
so there was little danger of his being
abroad. At this hour it was dark and deserted.</p>

<p>“Got your keys?” whispered Bob.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry, in the same low voice.
“But maybe I won’t need ’em.”</p>

<p>As they neared the chapel, and swung around
to the side where the door leading to the vestry
was, a black form rushed out of the bushes toward
them.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed Ned, nervously.</p>

<p>“Martin’s dog. Keep still!” commanded Jerry.
“Here, Jack, lie down! Go back!” he ordered.</p>

<p>The dog, which had not barked, was a friend
of every lad in the college. He fawned upon the
three plotters and then, satisfied that they did
not want to romp with him, Jack went back to his
kennel.</p>

<p>“Got out of that easy,” commented Jerry.</p>

<p>Cautiously they ascended the steps and tried
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“Open,” announced Jerry. “I won’t have to
use the keys. Come on in, and don’t stumble over
a chair or any of the kneeling benches.”</p>

<p>They entered the dark vestry and closed the
door behind them.</p>

<p>“Bear cats and little kittens!” muttered Ned.
“It’s as black as a bottle of ink.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a flashlight,” announced Jerry, producing
a pocket electric lamp. By its light the
boys made their way out of the vestry, up on the
platform and over to where the picture hung.</p>

<p>“Got to have a ladder to reach it,” announced
Bob.</p>

<p>“Put one of the big pulpit chairs on top of
another and we can reach it,” said Jerry. “I figured
that out when I was here this morning.”</p>

<p>“Big head!” ejaculated Ned.</p>

<p>Jerry was right about the chairs, and on this
rather shaky pyramid, while Ned and Bob steadied
it, Jerry reached up and lifted down the
picture, no easy task, for it was in a heavy gold
frame.</p>

<p>The Boxwood picture was one of the treasures
of the institution; not because of its intrinsic
worth, but because of the associations.</p>

<p>The Reverend Doctor Ebenezer Boxwood, to
give him his proper title, had founded the college
as a religious school, and the chapel was one of the
first buildings erected. He had been a clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of great scholarly attainments, and a natural
instructor.</p>

<p>Gradually, like many others of its kind, Boxwood
Hall broadened, and became a college in
which the divinity side was less and less emphasized
each year, though the institution still conferred
the degree of Doctor of Divinity upon
those who wished it, and who passed the necessary
tests.</p>

<p>So it was that the faculty of the college revered
the picture of the founder, even though the
boys did not. For, of course, none of the present
undergraduates had known the Rev. Dr. Ebenezer
Boxwood.</p>

<p>“Now hustle!” advised Jerry, when the picture
was safely down. “Put back the chairs, and we’ll
cut out of here.”</p>

<p>This was soon done, and, with the picture covered
with the black robe, the conspirators, first
looking about to make sure they were unobserved,
sneaked out the side door, and made their
way toward the flagpole.</p>

<p>Here was where the greatest danger of detection
lay, for they were out in the open, and though
the flagpole was not near any of the buildings it
was in a conspicuous place on the campus, and
the boys might be observed by some passing professor.</p>

<p>However, luck seemed to be with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<a href="#image04">they</a> quickly <a href="#image04">made the flag halyards fast to the
picture and hoisted it up</a> to the top of the pole,
making sure the fastenings were secure so the portrait
would not fall.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_173">THEY MADE THE FLAG HALYARDS FAST TO THE PICTURE AND
HOISTED IT UP.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Well, I guess that’s some nifty little trick,”
chuckled Jerry, as they hurried back to their
rooms.</p>

<p>“It’ll make ’em sit up and have gravy on their
eggs all right,” added Ned.</p>

<p>Chuckling over the success of their plot, the
three chums prepared to go to bed, for it was a
little past the hour for lights to be out, and they
did not want any suspicion to attach to them.</p>

<p>So sound and healthful was the sleep of Ned,
Bob and Jerry that it seemed but a few minutes
from the time they crawled into their beds until
their alarm clocks rattled in the morning, and they
sprang up. For they “cut things pretty fine,” to
quote Jerry, and only gave themselves just enough
time to jump into their clothes and run for chapel.</p>

<p>As they scudded across the campus, arranging
ties on the route, they looked across to the flagpole,
where they saw a group of students gathered
about, gazing up at the suspended portrait.</p>

<p>“It’s working!” chuckled Jerry.</p>

<p>The final bell rang, and the students about the
pole rushed to chapel.</p>

<p>“Some little trick—that of yours!” exclaimed
Tom Bacon, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no time for further talk as they
had to go to their seats, and there an air of subdued
excitement testified to the success of the
trick.</p>

<p>The doors were closed, Dr. Cole arose as usual,
but the usual announcement, that of an invitation
to all present to take part in the morning prayer,
was wanting.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, I regret to mention to you,
what the most of you probably know, that the
portrait of our revered founder is not in its usual
place,” Dr. Cole said in his deep voice.</p>

<p>“And before we go on with the devotional exercises
this morning I will request Hopkins, Baker
and Slade to proceed to the flagpole, where they
shamelessly hung the portrait, and bring it back!”</p>

<p>There was a gasp of astonishment, and the
three chums looked guiltily at one another.</p>

<p>“Go at once!” sternly ordered Dr. Cole.</p>

<p>Amid the smiles of their fellow students Jerry,
Ned and Bob filed out of chapel.</p>

<p>And when they reached the pole they saw a
card tacked on it, just below where the halyards
were made fast, and the card read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“This picture was placed here by</p>

<p class="ident">“Jerry Hopkins,</p>

<p class="ident">“Ned Slade,</p>

<p class="ident">“Bob Baker.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>THE COASTING RACE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Astonishment, surprise, chagrin and anger
are some of the words that might be used to describe
the feelings of Ned, Bob and Jerry as they
looked at the accusing card.</p>

<p>“Who put it there?”</p>

<p>“How did they find it out?”</p>

<p>“Somebody must have seen us!”</p>

<p>Thus spoke the three.</p>

<p>The card was typewritten, so there was no
ready clue to its author.</p>

<p>“Which of the fellows have typewriting machines?”
asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, a dozen. You can’t tell that way,” answered
Bob.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make a try,” declared Ned, vindictively.
“I’ve heard that each typewriting machine
has some peculiarity, and I may be able
to trace this one.</p>

<p>“If I do find out the sneak who gave us away
what I won’t do to him won’t be worth doing,”
Ned went on. “The idea of spoiling a perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
good joke this way! It’s a shame, and I’ll wager
a lot it was that Frank Watson!”</p>

<p>“There you go again!” cried Jerry. “Jumping
at conclusions.”</p>

<p>“I’ll jump on his head if I get a chance,” muttered
Ned.</p>

<p>Then they lowered the picture and carried it
back to the chapel, amid the grins of their companions
and the stern looks of the members of
faculty. Such a sacrilege had rarely, if ever before,
been committed. Each professor seemed
grave and angry, save Professor Snodgrass, and
he looked at the boys with sympathy. He would
have helped them if he could, but it was beyond his
power.</p>

<p>“You may set the portrait down against the
wall where it belongs,” announced Dr. Cole. “I
will have the janitor hang it later.”</p>

<p>In the prayer that followed, Dr. Cole made
reference to the “misguided and rash spirit of
youth,” from which he asked that all might be
delivered.</p>

<p>“He means us!” whispered Bob.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” retorted Ned, fiercely. “Don’t I
know it!”</p>

<p>It is feared that our heroes—shall I call them
that now, I wonder?—did not fully enter into the
devotional spirit that morning. Nor, for that
matter, did many of the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>When the chapel exercises were over, Dr. Cole
again arose.</p>

<p>“Hopkins, Slade and Baker will be excused
from classes to-day,” the president announced,
“and they will report at my office in half an hour.”</p>

<p>He gave the signal of dismissal.</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows sure have nerve all right!”
exclaimed George Fitch, as a group of students
gathered about Ned, Bob and Jerry when they
came out of chapel.</p>

<p>“That’s what!” added Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>“But why you wanted to give yourselves away
is more than I can figure out,” came from Harry
French.</p>

<p>“Getting the picture was sure some nifty
little stunt,” commented Chet Randell, “but sticking
that card on was only inviting trouble. Did
you think they wouldn’t believe it?”</p>

<p>“Say, when you fellows get through talking, I’ll
have something to say!” Ned broke in, rather
sarcastically. “We did get the picture, I may
as well admit that, for I suppose we gave ourselves
away in chapel when Proxy made the crack.
But we weren’t foolish enough to go and advertise
the fact. Some fellow squealed on us, just as
some one did at the time of our feed. And when
I find out who it was I’m going to make it so hot
for him he’ll leave college.”</p>

<p>Frank Watson was passing at the time, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
neither by look nor word did he show that he was
concerned, though Ned had gazed in his direction,
and had made his voice purposely loud.</p>

<p>“Do you mean him?” asked Newt Ackerson,
nodding toward Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying all I mean,” retorted Ned.</p>

<p>“No, you’d better not,” cautioned Jerry.
“Never mind, we’ve got to take our medicine.”</p>

<p>“More leave-stopping, I suppose,” groaned
Bob.</p>

<p>“If you’re not suspended, you’ll be getting off
lucky,” commented Ted Newton.</p>

<p>While the other students hurried, more or less
willingly, to their different lectures and classrooms,
Ned, Bob and Jerry strolled over toward
the office of the president.</p>

<p>They were admitted by Dr. Cole’s secretary,
a young man studying for the ministry, who ushered
them into the office, and gave them chairs.
The three chums did not feel much like talking,
so they sat in glum silence, waiting for Dr. Cole to
come in. They were beginning to think their offence
was graver than they had imagined it. Suspension
had not occurred to them. But, on the
other hand, they had not figured on being found
out. Something was wrong.</p>

<p>“Frank might have heard us talking about it
from his room,” said Ned in a low voice. “His
transom is right opposite yours, Jerry, and voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
carry easily in that corridor, I’ve noticed. It’s a
regular sound-box.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think,” Jerry said.
“We’re found out, that’s sure.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll find out who squealed,” declared Ned,
taking the card out of his pocket to gaze at it.
Then Dr. Cole came in, and Ned quickly put away
the bit of evidence.</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, before I say what I intend
to, I wish to be perfectly fair and just to you,”
began the president. “Did you, or did you not
put the picture on the flagpole. Answer me on
your honor as gentlemen and students at Boxwood
Hall.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Jerry
spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>“We did it, Dr. Cole,” he said.</p>

<p>“So I was informed.”</p>

<p>Ned just ached to ask who had been the informant,
but he knew he did not dare.</p>

<p>Dr. Cole seemed to be thinking deeply, and
then he began to speak.</p>

<p>He gave the boys a straight-from-the-shoulder
talk—a good, manly lecture, in which he explained
to them why he regarded their offense seriously.
They might have played other pranks that would
not have had such a possible effect as the irreparable
damage of the founder’s picture. If that
had been torn it would have been a grave loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>And from that Dr. Cole went into a general exposition
of boyish pranks in general. It was a talk
along the same lines as had been given to the boys
by their parents before they were sent to Boxwood
Hall. They were reminded that they were
now growing up, and should give some evidences
of it.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry, rather angry at first that
they had been caught, and filled with perhaps
righteous indignation against the informer, began
to see matters in a different light. They were
rather ashamed of themselves, and Jerry frankly
admitted that the entire idea was his, and that
he had persuaded Bob and Ned to join him. In
view of that fact he asked that he alone be punished.</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Cole. “I can’t do that. But I
will make yours the heaviest, for I think you deserve
it. You are older than your chums, not
much it is true, but a little, and they look to you
as to a natural leader. You should lead them
along different lines.”</p>

<p>And then came the punishment. It was heavy,
but justly so. There was to be a period
of confinement to the college grounds, longest in
the case of Jerry, and there was also prohibition
to take part in any games or amusements, or to
attend their fraternity meetings for a certain period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed Ned as they emerged from
the president’s office, “that was bitter medicine
all right.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess we deserve it,” observed Jerry.</p>

<p>“But we <em>did</em> stir things up,” Bob said, with a
smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, we stirred up a hornet’s nest,” remarked
Ned. “And I’d like to get it around the ears of
the fellow who told—Frank it was, to my way of
thinking.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have your own troubles proving it,”
remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>The three chums spent a miserable time when
they were on probation, so to speak, unable to join
in the fun the others had. And though the time
of Bob and Ned was up before that of Jerry, the
two refused to accept their restored privileges, and
stuck to their chum, not going anywhere he could
not go.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this that led Dr. Cole to shorten
Jerry’s term of punishment, for on the night following
a big snow storm, when half the college
was out on the hill on big bobsleds, coasting, word
was sent to Jerry that he was given back his full
privileges.</p>

<p>Just outside the college grounds was a long hill,
most excellent for coasting, and it was the custom
at Boxwood Hall to have impromptu bobsled
races for class and school championships. Ned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Bob and Jerry had bought a big bobsled from
a former student, and they had done some coasting
earlier in the season.</p>

<p>“But this is the best yet!” cried Ned. “The
hill is in prime shape. We’ll get up a race.”</p>

<p>Laughing, shouting, calling to one another, the
three chums, now restored to full rights of collegeship,
hastened out with their companions to
the coasting place.</p>

<p>It was a bright moonlight night, and many of
the boys and girls from Fordham were on the hill.</p>

<p>“Get up a party and we’ll see if we can’t have
a race,” suggested Jerry to his chums.</p>

<p>Getting up a party for the fine, big bobsled was
easy. There were soon more than enough to fill
it. As the three chums were getting the sled to
the top of the hill ready for a start, Frank Watson
came along dragging his bobsled, which was
slightly larger than that Jerry was going to steer.
Frank had his party made up, in it being Bart
Haley and Bill Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Want a race, Jerry?” asked Bart, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Without thinking, for the minute, of the feeling
against Frank, Jerry answered:</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“Come on then!” cried Bart. “The losers
buy the hot chocolates!”</p>

<p>Frank nodded his assent.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE ICE BOAT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Fordham Hill was over a mile long, and it
was so wide that several big bobsleds could go
down abreast. Thus a race could be going on,
and independent coasting could be indulged in at
the same time.</p>

<p>“Let me steer, Jerry,” begged Ned, for the tall
lad had taken his place at the wheel.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to steer?”</p>

<p>“I want to beat that sneak, that’s why! He
thinks he’s all there is, with his bunch of girls
from town. I’m going to beat him!”</p>

<p>“All right,” Jerry assented. “Only look out
for yourself, that’s all. I’ve heard of Frank’s
bob. It’s a fast one, and he knows how to handle
it. Ours is a bit stiff.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll beat him all right. You get the crowd
aboard.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps but natural that Ned should
wish to win against his enemy, and Frank was
Ned’s enemy rather than that of either Bob or
Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pile on! Get your places!” yelled Bart.
“Here’s where we win the hot chocolates!”</p>

<p>“Get ready, boys!” called Jerry, who went to
the rear of the bobsled, there to handle the brake
lever. For the big bobsleds had brakes—a sort
of spike that dug down in the snow and retarded
the progress of the sled. Frank’s bobsled was
similarly equipped, and Bill Hamilton was to be
the brakesman.</p>

<p>A number of girls from Fordham, whom Jerry,
Ned and Bob had met at dances, took their places
on the sled of our heroes. There were about
the same number of boys as girls on Frank’s
coaster also.</p>

<p>Several lads volunteered to push off, and for
a time there was more interest in the race than in
the other coasting.</p>

<p>“All ready?” asked Bart of Jerry, from the
rear where he sat.</p>

<p>“All ready,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>“Push!” cried Bart.</p>

<p>“Push!” echoed Jerry.</p>

<p>The boys behind the two bobsleds exerted their
strength, and the long coasters, with their loads
of laughing, shouting and merry boys and girls,
began to move slowly. Once over the crest of
the hill they gathered momentum, until they were
shooting down the moonlit streak of ice and snow
at ever increasing speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>In places water had been poured over the snow,
and this in freezing had added a glair that increased
the speed of the sleds.</p>

<p>A coasting race is a peculiar one. Given two
sleds of exactly the same size, with equally polished
runners, and with weights nearly the same,
start them at the same time, and one will get to
the bottom of the hill ahead of the other.</p>

<p>Try it again, and the results may be reversed.
Just why this is so it is hard to say, unless it is that
the winning sled may, without the knowledge of
the rider, strike more slippery places than the
other. Of course, weight has something to do
with it, once the sleds are started, the more heavily
laden one acquiring greater momentum. But
sometimes even that may not count.</p>

<p>The bobsled of our heroes and that of Frank
Watson were about evenly weighted, but, as Jerry
had said, the steering gear of theirs was a little
stiff, while their rival had a new sled in excellent
condition.</p>

<p>“But we’ll beat him,” said Ned to Bob, who sat
behind him.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” agreed Chunky.</p>

<p>So far the sleds were on even terms, almost in
a straight line with one another. Then, as the
slope of the hill became steeper, Frank gradually
forged ahead.</p>

<p>“He’s going to win,” said Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“The race isn’t over yet,” muttered Ned, yet
he was a bit doubtful now as to the outcome.</p>

<p>“Come on there! Come on!” shouted those on
Frank’s sled to those on the other. “Come on,
we’re leaving you behind!”</p>

<p>“We’re coming!” shrilly cried the girls on the
second bobsled.</p>

<p>“We’ll tell them that when we reach the bottom
of the hill,” answered their rivals.</p>

<p>Farther and farther ahead forged Frank’s sled.
It was half a length in the lead now, and though
Ned tried to pick out the smoothest and slipperiest
places, he could not gain anything.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, without any apparent reason
for it, unless it was that it came to a glair in the
ice, Frank’s bobsled shot swiftly ahead, until, in
a few seconds, it was leading by two lengths.</p>

<p>“Oh you hot chocolates!” taunted the leaders,
laughingly.</p>

<p>And then, still apparently for no reason, Frank
sent his sled, which was on the right of Ned’s,
diagonally across the course, in front of the sled
behind, a rather dangerous proceeding.</p>

<p>“What’s he doing that for?” cried Ned.
“Brakes there, Jerry, or we’ll run into him!”</p>

<p>Jerry jammed down the brakes, and only just
in time, for their bobsled seemed suddenly to acquire
new speed, and it almost crashed into the one
ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a scraping in the hard snow, which
flew up in a shower behind, and several of the
girls screamed. Then Ned cried:</p>

<p>“All right! Off brakes! Now we’ll beat him!”</p>

<p>For Ned saw on the course Frank had chosen
to abandon, a long stretch of hard, icy snow, and
he knew that his vehicle could acquire speed and
momentum over there.</p>

<p>In a moment he steered for it, so that the positions
of the sleds were reversed, Ned’s being on
the right hand side going down.</p>

<p>On and on raced the sleds. That of the three
chums was rapidly overtaking the rival coaster.</p>

<p>“Frank thought he’d get on an icier place by
cutting across that way,” said Ned to Bob. “But
he missed his guess. We’re going to win now.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could think so.”</p>

<p>“We are; you watch!”</p>

<p>And as Bob and the others behind him looked,
they saw Ned skillfully hold to the icy course.
It gave them more speed, which seemed to be constantly
on the increase. They were now so close
to Frank’s bob that he dared not cut across again,
had he so desired.</p>

<p>“Here we go!” cried Ned, as, having passed
over a place where loose snow retarded them a
bit, they shot out on to a spot that was solid ice.
“Here’s where we win!”</p>

<p>And win they did. For a moment later the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of the slope was reached with Ned’s bobsled
well in advance, and as there was only a straight
course left on which to bring up, there was no
chance for Frank to acquire further speed.</p>

<p>“We win! We win!” cried the boys on Ned’s
vehicle, as they got off when the sled came to a
stop. “We win!”</p>

<p>“Oh you hot chocolates!” shrilled the girls at
their less lucky companions.</p>

<p>“Does whipped cream go with it, Bart?” asked
one of the winning girls.</p>

<p>“Well, seeing that you whipped us, so to speak,
I guess it does,” admitted Frank’s chum. The latter
said nothing, but there was a glum look on his
face as he got up from the steering wheel. He
was a poor loser.</p>

<p>“As headstrong as ever,” thought Jerry. “I
wish something would happen to change him. If
he keeps on holding a grudge against us this way
we won’t stand any chance on the baseball nine,
for, as captain, Frank has nearly all the say
there.”</p>

<p>With shouts and laughter the victors chaffed the
vanquished, and then they made their way to
the Band Box, the most popular confectionery and
ice cream store in Fordham, and there hot chocolates
and cake were provided by the losers for
their more fortunate rivals.</p>

<p>It was a good-natured, jolly crowd, all save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Frank, and he was pleasant enough with every one
but the three Cresville chums.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you fellows mix in with them a
bit?” asked Jake Porter of Frank, Bart and Bill
a little later.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want to,” said Frank. “We
agreed that they’d try to run things here, and they
have. They’re too fresh. And you were one of
those, Jake, to agree to snub ’em. Now you’re
sticking up for ’em.”</p>

<p>“I know; but I’ve found out they aren’t half
bad. They’re real jolly.”</p>

<p>“I like Jerry all right,” confessed Bart. “He
did me a good turn. Maybe it’s time to make better
friends with them, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Not for me! You fellows can do what you
like!” exclaimed the headstrong youth.</p>

<p>“Ned and Bob are all right, too,” said Bill
Hamilton. “I was broke the other day and Bob
lent me some money.”</p>

<p>“And you took it?” asked Frank, sharply.</p>

<p>“Of course. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you come to me?”</p>

<p>“You weren’t around, and I wasn’t going to
cut off my nose to spite my face. I think maybe
we made a mistake, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t. I’ll not make friends with ’em!”</p>

<p>The coasting was over, and as the boys returned
to college with their sled, Jerry remarked:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, you did beat him, Ned. It was a clever
piece of work.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to beat him more ways than one, the
cad!”</p>

<p>“You’ll never get anywhere feeling that way
about Frank.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to get anywhere with <em>him</em>. I want
to be in a position to prove he gave away the picture
game and then I’ll go for him.”</p>

<p>There came a thaw. The snow disappeared,
and there followed a period of warmer weather
and rain. Then it became cold again, so cold that
Lake Carmona was frozen over solidly, and there
was the best skating that had been enjoyed in
years, so some of the older students declared.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry were on the ice one afternoon
enjoying the sport, when Jerry, who had
been quiet for some time, burst out with:</p>

<p>“I think I’ll do it if you fellows will go in with
me.”</p>

<p>“What’s he talking about now?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is all right,” Jerry went on. “I was
thinking aloud, I guess. I heard of a fellow who
has an ice-boat for sale up the lake. What do
you say to our buying it, or hiring it, and having
some fun? It’s lots of sport.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see the ice-boat first,” suggested
Ned practically.</p>

<p>“Come on,” cried Jerry.</p>

<small>SPRING PRACTICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, what do you think of her?”</p>

<p>Jerry asked the question of his two chums a
little later as they stood looking at the odd craft.</p>

<p>“She’s big enough,” commented Ned, gazing
up at the tall mast.</p>

<p>“Can she go?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“You ought to see her! She’s won more races
than any boat of her class on this lake,” said the
owner, a Mr. Brown, who was going to move
away and wanted to sell the craft.</p>

<p>“May we give it a trial?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Certainly. I’ll take you out in it to-morrow
and show you how to run it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad of that,” Jerry said. “I’ve handled
one a few times, but I’m not an expert.”</p>

<p>Satisfactory terms for the purchase of the <i>Petrel</i>
were made should she prove satisfactory on
trial, and the next day Ned, Bob and Jerry went
to Mr. Brown’s place. There was a good wind
blowing, not enough, the owner of the <i>Petrel</i> explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to get any real speed out of her, but
enough to show of what she was capable.</p>

<p>“And if I’m going to learn I’d rather do it in
a wind that isn’t a gale,” Jerry remarked.</p>

<p>The ice-boat had a sort of open cockpit, in
which five or six might sit, or sprawl over the side
if necessary, when it was desired to keep the
weight well out on one runner, to prevent the boat
from capsizing.</p>

<p>“Say, this is great!” cried Bob, as they went
skimming over the ice.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I sure do!”</p>

<p>“I’m in for it, too,” added Ned. “Show me
how to steer and manage the sail.”</p>

<p>Mr. Brown proved to be an adept instructor,
and the boys soon caught on to the knack of handling
the swift craft, though they needed practice.</p>

<p>“Here comes the <i>Jack Frost</i>,” said Mr. Brown,
nodding toward another ice-boat down the lake.
“We’ll have a little race with her. Mr. Carson
owns her, and he beat me the last time, though I
think I can win now, for my boat is better in a
light wind than his.”</p>

<p>A friendly challenge was at once accepted by
Mr. Carson, and the two graceful craft lined up
for a race. They were on a part of the lake
where there were no skaters and no other boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came a pretty exhibition. Even at first
with her rival, the <i>Petrel</i> soon forged ahead, and
then Mr. Brown let the boys take turns at the
tiller.</p>

<p>They did well, too, and at the finish line the
<i>Petrel</i> was several lengths in advance.</p>

<p>“Well, you had the edge on me this time!”
called Mr. Carson good-naturedly, as he came up
in the wind. “But I’ll beat you next.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take you up!” called Jerry. “It’s going
to be our boat from now on.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll take her?” asked Mr. Brown.</p>

<p>“Sure!” Jerry answered, his chums echoing an
assent.</p>

<p>The arrangements were completed the following
day, and the motor boys became possessed of
a new craft. Though once, years before, they
had made an ice-boat for use on the river at home,
which was not much of a success, however.</p>

<p>In the days that followed Ned, Bob and Jerry
spent as much time as they could on the ice, either
in the boat or on skates. But the ease of gliding
along without any exertion, the swiftness of
the motion and the sport of it caused them to use
the <i>Petrel</i> oftener than they did their skates.</p>

<p>And so the winter wore on.</p>

<p>There had been a thaw, a rain and a freeze,
and there were indications that an early spring
was on the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which, being the case,” remarked Ned, as he
and his chums sat in Jerry’s room one day, “I
think I will get out my baseball glove, and see if
it needs sewing.”</p>

<p>“It’s too soon to do that,” remarked Jerry.
“Come on down to the ice. Let’s take out the
<i>Petrel</i>. We may not have another chance.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>On the way to the lake the three chums met
Frank, Bart and Bill.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” asked Bart, who,
with Bill, was becoming more and more friendly
with our heroes.</p>

<p>“Out in the ice-boat,” answered Jerry, and
then, seeing an eager look on Bart’s face, the tall
lad added: “Come along. It may be the last
ride of the winter.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you!” Bart exclaimed. “Do you
mean all of us?”</p>

<p>Jerry did not hesitate a moment in answering:</p>

<p>“Yes, sure!”</p>

<p>“I’ll come,” said Bill.</p>

<p>Frank, with a sneer on his face, turned aside.</p>

<p>“You freshmen with your boats and things
make me tired!” he complained as he walked
away.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump,” advised Bart in a low
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mind your own business!” snapped Frank.</p>

<p>His two friends paused a moment, as though
undecided, and then walked along with Jerry and
the others.</p>

<p>“He’s as pig-headed as they make ’em,” commented
Bart. “I never saw his beat!”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Ned, but what he thought he
did not say.</p>

<p>Up and down the lake sailed the <i>Petrel</i>, and
as the sun was declining, Bob called to Jerry:</p>

<p>“Head her down to Simpson’s and we’ll have
something to eat.”</p>

<p>“That listens good,” laughed Bart.</p>

<p>“Oh, eating is my strong point!” Chunky confessed.</p>

<p>The ice-boat was skimming down the lake, when
there suddenly sounded a boom like the report
of a cannon.</p>

<p>“What was that?” called Ned.</p>

<p>“The ice cracked,” Jerry answered. “It often
does that after a thaw. I guess——”</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Bill. “There’s open water
just ahead!”</p>

<p>A big crack had opened in the ice, just in front
of the ice-boat, and before Jerry could steer to one
side the <i>Petrel</i> plunged in.</p>

<p>“Jump!” yelled Jerry, casting aside the mainsheet.</p>

<p>As the boat splashed into the cold water the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
boys, leaping free of her, went in also, but on
either side.</p>

<p>Jerry saw his two chums and Bill strike out
as they hit the water, but he also had a glimpse of
Bart throwing up his hands with a gesture of despair,
and in a flash it came to Jerry.</p>

<p>“Bart can’t swim!”</p>

<p>The lad had so confessed some time ago, admitting
he had a terror of being in the water,
though not afraid to go out in a boat.</p>

<p>Jerry launched himself through the ice-cold
element and grasped Bart by the collar. Holding
him up with one hand, he swam toward the ice-boat,
which had turned over on one side. It was
floating and would support them all for a time.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Bill had already reached the
craft, but Bart was struggling frantically.</p>

<p>“I—I can’t swim!” he gasped, spluttering the
words as water got in his mouth.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” cried Jerry. “I’ll save you!”</p>

<p>This he did. By dint of hard work he managed
to get Bart to the ice-boat and put his arms over
it.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” panted Jerry. “Help’s coming.”</p>

<p>Another ice-boat and several skaters who had
seen the accident were hurrying to the rescue.
Help was given promptly, fence rails and
ropes from the other boat being secured to assist
the boys out of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, dripping wet, and shivering with cold,
they were hurried to Simpson’s, where hot blankets
and hot drinks promptly administered were
used to prevent pneumonia.</p>

<p>“You—you saved my life, Jerry,” said Bart,
earnestly, when they were sitting before a warm
fire, waiting for a conveyance to take them back
to Boxwood Hall. “I—I won’t forget it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Jerry, sincerely.
“I’m glad I saw you in time, and I remembered
you said you couldn’t swim. You’d better learn
this summer.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to!” was the fervent response.</p>

<p>No ill effects, save slight colds for Ned and
Bart, followed the immersion. The ice-boat was
recovered and put away for the season, as the ice
broke up the next day and a long spring thaw
set in.</p>

<p>Ned, Bob and Jerry buckled down to hard
work, or at least fancied they did, and occasionally
they played some trick or joke, but were not
caught again.</p>

<p>Ned kept on the “typewriter trail,” as he called
it, but with no success, and he was not able to
fasten any guilt on Frank. After the ice-boat accident
Bart and Bill were more than ever friendly
with the three chums, Bart especially, and when
Frank remonstrated, Bart said:</p>

<p>“What would you do to the fellow who saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
your life, or the life of some one you cared for?”</p>

<p>Frank could not answer, and turned aside. But
he did not make friends.</p>

<p>The winter, not necessarily of discontent,
passed and spring came. There had been practice
of a sort in the indoor baseball cage when one day
a notice was posted on the gymnasium bulletin
board to this effect:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Candidates for the varsity nine will report on
the field this afternoon for spring practice.</i></p></div>

<p>“Hurrah! That’s the ticket!” cried Jerry.</p>

<p>“That means us all right,” added Bob.</p>

<p>“It’ll feel good to get a bat in your hands out
in the open,” commented Ned.</p>

<p>There were days of hard practice, and Ned,
Bob and Jerry were assured by several of their
chums that they stood a good chance to make the
first team.</p>

<p>“How about it, Frank?” asked Jerry one day,
after sharp work, in which the team on which
our heroes played won from the tentative varsity,
mainly by the skillful playing of the three
motor chums. Jerry resolved to take the bull by
the horns. “How about it? Have we a chance
on the varsity?”</p>

<p>“Not in a hundred years while I’m captain!”
was the cutting reply.</p>

<small>A SCRUB GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned Slade, who stood near Jerry, heard what
was said. He took a step forward, but the tall
lad put out a restraining hand. And, as Ned
looked at his chum, Jerry shook his head in negation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” demanded Ned,
when Frank had walked out of hearing distance.
“Why don’t you let me soak him a good one?”</p>

<p>“Because it would have been a bad one,” answered
Jerry. “It would only have made matters
worse. I want to play on the varsity nine and
so do you and Bob, and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we let this sneak Frank have his
way we’ll never get on,” interrupted Ned. “If
you’d let me mix it up with him it would take some
of the starch and pig-headedness out of him, and
he’d have to let us play.”</p>

<p>“No,” and Jerry shook his head, “that would
only make matters worse. He’d be more set in
his ways than ever. You leave it to me.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” Bob wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
know. “It doesn’t seem that there’s anything to
do.”</p>

<p>“All we can do for a while is to wait,” Jerry
said. “You see Bart and Bill, who used to be as
much against us as Frank is, are friendly with us
now. And we’ve won over a good many others
of Frank’s cronies. Not that we ever did anything
that they shouldn’t be friendly with us, but it just
happened so. It was all because Professor Snodgrass
made the mistake of telling too much about
us in advance. I can see that. He didn’t exactly
boast of what we’d done, but it sounded so to some
of the boys, and we’ve got to live down that reputation.</p>

<p>“We’re doing it, too, and I wouldn’t have the
dear old professor know, for the world, what a
pickle he innocently got us into. We’ll just wait,
and it will come around all right, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not!” exclaimed Ned, who was in
an angry mood. “I’m for giving Frank a good
walloping, and bringing him to his senses.”</p>

<p>“How is it he has such a control where the varsity
nine is concerned?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, as I get the story,” said Jerry, “Frank
put the nine on its feet. When he came here
Boxwood Hall wasn’t much of anywhere as regards
baseball. Now Frank is a good player—a
crackerjack! I’ll give him credit for that, pig-headed
as he is. He’s a natural born player<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and manager, and he took hold of the nine and
pulled it out of the mud. He helped with money,
too, bought new uniforms and all that. Naturally,
he was made captain and manager, and, in a way,
coach too.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they make him the whole team
while they were about it?” asked Ned, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it did come pretty near amounting
to that,” laughed Jerry. “Anyhow, he demanded,
so I heard, and was given the right to
say who should and should not play on the varsity.
In his capacity as captain and manager he
retains that right. If he doesn’t want a fellow to
play, that fellow keeps on the scrub or sits on the
bench.”</p>

<p>“And he doesn’t want us to play,” remarked
Ned, bitterly.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem so,” agreed Jerry. “But we’ll
wait.”</p>

<p>“It’s a funny state of affairs,” remarked Bob,
“where one fellow can run the whole varsity nine
and say who shall and who sha’n’t play.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” admitted the tall chum. “But in
this case it has worked out well, for Boxwood
Hall won the championship last year, which it
never did before, and defeated the military academy
two out of the three games which are an annual
feature. So that’s why the fellows let Frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
have his way. They knew he made the nine, and
he’s making good with it yet. It isn’t that we
can play better than the fellows on it, it’s just
that I want to be on the varsity.”</p>

<p>“So do I!” chimed in Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“And we’ve just got to wait until Frank either
changes his mind, or until we can show that we
can play so much better than some of the regulars
that there’ll be a demand that we go in,” finished
Jerry. “Now let’s go for a ride and forget
our troubles.”</p>

<p>Ned was still bitter against Frank, though,
and did not see why the three chums could not
be put on the varsity.</p>

<p>As the three were riding off, Professor Snodgrass,
equipped with his net and specimen box,
hailed them.</p>

<p>“My first butterfly hunt of the season!” he
called to the boys. “I’m after some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argynnis cybele</i>
specimens, which appear with the first violets.”</p>

<p>“Come with us,” said Jerry. “Do you want
to go to any particular place?”</p>

<p>“No, only to the nearest patch of woods where
violets may be found. I haven’t any good specimens
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argynnis</i>, and I am anxious to secure
some,” the little scientist explained as he entered
the automobile.</p>

<p>“What does it look like?” asked Jerry. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
don’t want you to be making stabs at colored
leaves, which you’ll do if we let Bob do the looking.”</p>

<p>“I can tell a butterfly as well as you!” retorted
the stout youth.</p>

<p>“The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Argynnis cybele</i>,” said Professor Snodgrass,
“is sometimes called the great spangled Fritillary.
In color it is a sort of light brownish
yellow, with brown and yellow spots, and the
under sides of the wings are heavily silvered.
The caterpillars hibernate as soon as hatched,
and live that way all winter. In the spring they
feed up, and turn into butterflies about the time
the first violets appear. I hope we shall get some
to-day.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you look,” Ned promised.</p>

<p>Arriving at the patch of woods, they all got
out of the automobile and began searching.</p>

<p>“Here are some violets,” called Jerry after a
while.</p>

<p>“Then perhaps there may be a butterfly near
them,” the professor answered, hastening over
toward the tall lad. “Yes, there’s one!” he cried,
his trained eyes seeing it before any of the others.
“Wait now until he lights, and I’ll have
him!”</p>

<p>The professor stood with poised net. One foot
went into a puddle of water, but he did not seem
to mind that. Then, with a sweep of his net he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
captured the beautiful specimen, and soon transferred
it to his cyanide bottle.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Excellent!” murmured Professor
Snodgrass. “I would not have missed this for
anything. But I—er—something seems to be the
matter,” he went on in puzzled tones.</p>

<p>“The matter? Where?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“With one of my feet. It seems so cold. Can
it be frost bitten?” and he looked down at the
ground. The boys did too, and broke out into
peals of laughter. For the professor was still
standing with one foot in the puddle of cold water,
a fact to which he had been oblivious while engaged
in capturing and putting away the butterfly.</p>

<p>“You ought to wear rubber boots,” Jerry said.
“Shall we take you back to get a dry shoe?”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t as cold as it was at first, and I want
to get another specimen.”</p>

<p>He had good luck, for he secured two more,
and then consented to be driven back to the cottage.</p>

<p>“Same old professor,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” agreed Bob.</p>

<p>Baseball practice went on for several days, and
the varsity was getting in good shape, while the
scrub, or second team, under the captaincy of Tom
Bacon, was making shifts and changes, trying to
get the best lads fitted to the right positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no trouble about Ned, Bob and Jerry
making the scrub. They played good ball, and
Ned was picked for pitcher, while Jerry was on
first and Bob at shortstop.</p>

<p>“First varsity-scrub game of the season to-morrow,”
was the announcement on the gymnasium
board one afternoon.</p>

<p>“And we’ll see if we can’t do ’em up!” exclaimed
Ned. “We’ll show Frank Watson that
he isn’t such a much.”</p>

<p>“We’ll beat ’em if we can,” agreed Jerry.</p>

<p>The two nines ran out on the diamond which
had been put in fine shape. A crowd of students
swarmed out to watch the first practice game of
the season and to get a line on the work of the
varsity.</p>

<p>“Play hard now, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Soak ’em in, Ned!”</p>

<p>“Don’t fan out varsity!”</p>

<p>“Watch for double steals, Jerry!”</p>

<p>Thus called the student spectators.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire, after the warm-up
practice. The scrubs were to bat first, and
Gene Flarity was up.</p>

<p>The game commenced. It was not remarkable
for brilliant playing on either side, but Ned, Bob
and Jerry, determined to show their mettle,
worked so hard, and Ned and Jerry teamed it
to such good advantage that the score was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tied, which had not happened to the varsity in a
long while.</p>

<p>“And here’s where we beat ’em!” exclaimed
Ned, when the ninth inning came, and he was at
bat. Ned made a good hit. It was safe for two
bags, and when Chet Randell duplicated, after
one man fanned out, Ned came in with the winning
run. That is, it would be if he could hold
the varsity hitless.</p>

<p>And he did. He struck out the first man, while
the second singled and was caught napping at
first.</p>

<p>“Come on now, boys, we want to get this
game!” cried Frank. He was at bat, and with two
out, there was but a slim chance. But Frank was
a pinch hitter, and he faced Ned with a sneer.</p>

<p>“You won’t win the game!” thought Ned, bitterly.</p>

<p>He sent in a swift ball, and it looked as though
it was going to hit Frank, who moved back just
a trifle.</p>

<p>“Strike!” howled the umpire.</p>

<p>“I’ve got your number all right,” exulted Ned.</p>

<p>Frank hit the next one, but it was a foul which
the catcher made desperate efforts to get.</p>

<p>“And you’re out!” Ned whispered to himself,
as he sent in a beautiful curve, which completely
fooled the batter.</p>

<p>“You’re out!” echoed the umpire.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>A VARSITY LOSS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“What do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“Varsity beaten the first game!”</p>

<p>“The scrubs win!”</p>

<p>“Say, that Ned Slade sure can pitch!”</p>

<p>“And did you see Bob scoop up that hot
grounder and get it to first?”</p>

<p>“Well, the varsity didn’t really get warmed
up.”</p>

<p>“That home run of Sid Lenton’s was a peach,
though!”</p>

<p>These were some of the comments that could
be heard as the students filed off the diamond after
the sensational finish of the practice game.</p>

<p>“Well, you did us,” said Bart Haley, with a
smile at Jerry.</p>

<p>“But we’ll do you next time,” added Bill Hamilton.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope you do,” admitted Jerry. “We
want the varsity to beat its other college opponents,
and we scrubs are willing to be beaten if that
comes about.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank did not join in the talk, but there was
a sullen look on his face. Clearly he did not fancy
being beaten, especially when it was due to the
work of Ned primarily, and to his own failure to
hit, secondarily.</p>

<p>“Great work, boys! Great!” ejaculated Tom
Bacon, captain of the scrubs. “That was a peach
of a pick-up of yours, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“And you certainly pulled down that high one
I threw you, Jerry,” added George Fitch, who, at
third, had caught a bouncing ball and heaved it
over to first, but so high that Jerry had to jump
for it, narrowly missing the spheroid. But he put
out his man.</p>

<p>“Some little curve you’ve got, to fool Frank,”
said Lem Ferguson to Ned.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not such a hitter.”</p>

<p>“He’s considered pretty good, and his average
is the best on the team,” declared George. “Oh,
Frank is a good player, even if there are some
things about him some fellows don’t like.”</p>

<p>The first practice game, in which the varsity
went down to defeat even by so small a margin,
was the talk of the college that night. Still, it
was not so important as the fact would have been
later in the season. The boys had not quite settled
into their stride.</p>

<p>Frank called a meeting of the team, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
“laid down the law,” as Bart said afterward.
Frank insisted that there must be more snappy
playing, nor did he excuse himself for missing
Ned’s curve.</p>

<p>“I played rotten, fellows, I admit that,” he
said, “but so did you, and we’ve got to do better
or Kenwell will walk all over us.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got a dandy team, I hear,” said Bill
Hamilton. “Some new fellows have come on,
and they’ve got a pitcher——”</p>

<p>“So have we,” interrupted Frank. “I’ll back
Jim Blake against any man they have when Jim
gets warmed up.”</p>

<p>“Thank you!” laughed Jim, making a bow.</p>

<p>“But we’ve all got to play harder,” declared
Frank. “If the scrub beats us again—well, they
mustn’t, that’s all, if we have to ‘bean’ some of
their best men.”</p>

<p>“Meaning those motor boy fellows, as you call
them?” asked Jake Porter.</p>

<p>“I’m not mentioning any names,” retorted
Frank. “Only play hard, that’s all.”</p>

<p>There was another practice game two days
later, and though the scrub did its best to beat the
varsity, the second nine was beaten six to ten.
Ned, Bob and Jerry were a trio of strength, but
they lacked support at critical moments, and
though Ned did not allow many hits, those that
were made off him were well placed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“This is more like it,” said Frank to his lads,
as they walked off the field. “They only beat us
the other time by a fluke.”</p>

<p>“A fluke! Huh!” exclaimed Ned. “We’ll have
a few more of those same flukes served up to you
soon.”</p>

<p>“Don’t start anything,” begged Jerry, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The varsity was playing good ball, though there
was room for improvement, and Frank realized
it. He was a good captain and manager, though
his stubbornness was not of any benefit to him nor
the team.</p>

<p>The time was approaching for the first game
of the three with Kenwell. This would take place
on the grounds of the military academy. The second
game would be played at Boxwood Hall, and
the third, if it were needed, would be played at
either place, to be decided by lot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the varsity team played other
nines, winning some games and losing a few, on
the whole maintaining its reputation. But the
other games did not count in the opinion of the
lads as much as did the annual contests with Kenwell.
That was the event looked forward to almost
as much as was a world series. The two
institutions had long been rivals.</p>

<p>The scrub nine, compared to the number of
games played against other scrubs, won more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the varsity. For there were several small colleges
and preparatory schools in the neighborhood of
Fordham, and, as these had second nines, contests
were arranged with them running through
the spring.</p>

<p>The day before the first of the Kenwell-Boxwood
games Ned, Bob, Jerry and the other members
of the scrub nine, played the Kenwell scrub,
and beat them ten to five on the military academy
grounds.</p>

<p>“Now let the varsity duplicate and we’ll say
we’ve got a good team,” declared Tom Bacon.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll win; don’t worry!” prophesied
Frank.</p>

<p>A big crowd of Boxwood Hall rooters went to
Kenwell to see the first of the three contests. A
big auto-stage conveyed the team, and in the automobile
of our heroes as many of the scrubs as
could find room went along to cheer for their
team.</p>

<p>It was a perfect day, and there was a large
crowd on hand. The rival cheer leaders got their
cohorts going early, and songs and battle cries
were wafted back and forth across the field. The
boys from the academy, in their natty uniforms,
made a pretty picture, and there were a number of
girls and women present, so the grounds, with the
vari-colored hats and dresses of the feminine contingent,
held a brilliant assemblage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank and Captain Oscar Durand, the latter
of Kenwell, held a consultation, submitted batting
lists, and flipped the coin. Frank won and chose
to bat last, naturally.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” directed the umpire, as there came
a hush in the singing and cheering.</p>

<p>“Don’t I wish I were in the game!” exclaimed
Ned, who with his two chums and others sat
among the loyal rooters.</p>

<p>“So do I,” echoed Bob.</p>

<p>“Well, we may yet. The season isn’t half
over,” remarked Jerry.</p>

<p>The play started. There was nothing remarkable
about it at first. For a few innings there
was a sort of pitchers’ battle, and some pop flies
were knocked by both sides.</p>

<p>“The boys are beginning to get on to each other’s
curves,” said Bob.</p>

<p>Then came a break. Jim Blake served up a
slow ball to Ford Tatum, the Kenwell catcher,
who banged it out for a three bagger. And Durand,
the captain, with a two sack beauty, brought
the man in with a run that put the military lads
ahead. That started things going. Several other
players got hits off Jim, and the inning ended finally
with the Kenwell lads four runs ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s all over but the shouting,” commented
Ned.</p>

<p>“We may have a chance,” Jerry returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sock” Burchell, the Kenwell pitcher, had good
curves and a fast ball. For the next two innings
he held the Boxwood Hall lads to a single hit.
Not a run came in. Then Frank knocked a
homer which brought the crowd to its feet and sent
new hope thrilling through the veins of the college
team and its coherents.</p>

<p>Whether Frank’s sensational run made him lose
his head, or whether he tried desperate measures,
was not disclosed. At any rate, he directed the
game wrongly from then on. He gave signals for
hits and runs when he should not have done so,
and while at first base, coaching, gave a wrong direction
to a runner which caused him to be thrown
out at second.</p>

<p>Then the fielders began muffing balls, the first
baseman dropped one he should have held, and
when the Boxwood Hall boys came up to bat for
the last time they had a margin of six runs to
overcome.</p>

<p>“The fat’s in the fire now,” sighed Bob.</p>

<p>And so it was. One man singled, but that was
all. The next went out on a foul tip, and “Sock”
struck out the two following.</p>

<p>Boxwood Hall had lost.</p>

<small>DISSENSIONS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Dejected and discouraged, but still bravely
giving a cheer for their victorious rivals, the
Boxwood Hall team left the field. The military
rooters were singing their songs, but the blue
and yellow pennants of the defeated ones drooped
sadly.</p>

<p>“They didn’t do a thing to us, did they?”
said Bart, somewhat cheerfully under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Well, they mightn’t have done so much if you
hadn’t muffed that long fly,” snapped Frank, for
Bart had done that.</p>

<p>“The sun——” he began.</p>

<p>“Same old excuse,” sneered the captain.
“You’d better get a pair of green goggles.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you were going to tell me to
try for that steal,” observed the lad who had
been caught at second.</p>

<p>“You should have had your wits about you!”
complained Frank, though really it was his fault
that the misplay had been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ve got to do a whole lot better if we
want the championship,” said Jake Porter.</p>

<p>“Guess you’d better get another pitcher,” remarked
Jim. “I couldn’t seem to get ’em over
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve seen you do better,” admitted
Frank, with less bitterness in his voice than he
had used toward the others. “But you sure have
got to perk up, and so have the rest of us. We
want the next two games, and we’ve got to get
’em!”</p>

<p>“So say we all of us!” chanted Bart. “Say,
Frank, why don’t you give Jerry, Ned or Bob a
show in the next game?” he asked. “They have
been doing some swell playing against the other
scrub nines, and you know what a tussle they
gave us.”</p>

<p>“It might be a good idea to put them in a
couple of games,” added Bill. “I’m not saying
anything against Jim,” he went on, “but Ned
sure has a swift ball.”</p>

<p>“Those fellows don’t play on the varsity while
I’m captain,” said Frank sullenly. “They’ve got
too good an opinion of themselves now, and if
they played on the first team they’d think they
owned the college. They can’t come in!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” cried some of Frank’s closest
friends. “With their auto and their boat they’ll
think they’re too good for Boxwood after a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“They can play ball all right, and better than
some of us,” declared a centre fielder who had
muffed a ball, letting in a run. “And when I say
that I include myself,” he admitted frankly. “I
did rotten work to-day.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, you did!” snapped Frank.
“And don’t let it happen again.”</p>

<p>“If I do, will you put in one of the three inseparables?”
was the question, for so Ned, Bob
and Jerry were called at times.</p>

<p>“Not in a hundred years!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Oh, give ’em a chance!” pleaded some, including
Bart and Bill.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it! Too much swelled head!”
insisted others.</p>

<p>From this discussion there came a dissension
among some members of the nine, as well as
among the supporters of the team. The three
chums were made the subject of a not very pleasant
discussion, and they begged those who favored
their playing to desist. But Bart and Bill
led a faction which insisted that our heroes be allowed
to play.</p>

<p>But Frank was stubborn and refused to consider
the matter.</p>

<p>“Our nine is all right as it is,” he said. “Just
because we lost one game to Kenwell doesn’t
mean we’ll lose more. I’m not going to change
my mind. Those fellows can’t play on the varsity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and that settles it,” and he banged his bat
down hard on the floor of the auto-truck in which
the defeated team was returning.</p>

<p>The subject was dropped for the time being,
and was not mentioned to Frank again for several
days by those favoring Jerry and his chums.
But those opposed to them, on no good grounds
whatsoever, nagged Frank into keeping firm in
his determination.</p>

<p>The baseball season waxed. Because of the
playing of Jerry, Ned and Bob the scrub nine
won game after game, succumbing only to teams
much their superior. They were doing much
better than the varsity, which lost a number of
games to institutions it had beaten easily the previous
years. But there were still the two games
with Kenwell, and by getting both of these the
reputation of Boxwood could be maintained.</p>

<p>“But the team is in a slump,” said Bart. “It’s
in a slump, and Frank knows it.”</p>

<p>“Only he’s too pig-headed to admit it,” agreed
Bill Hamilton. “If he would let those motor
boys in even for a couple of easy games, it would
show what they can do and inspire confidence.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it would give the regulars a rest,”
went on Bart. “That is what some of us need—a
rest. We’re overtrained, and it’s showing.
Kenwell will walk away with us next time, you
see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope not, but I’m afraid so,” agreed Bill.</p>

<p>But when once more Frank’s closest friends
ventured to plead with him for the three chums
he got so angry that they decided it was no use.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood about a week before the
second game with the military academy.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I’ve a feeling in my bones that something
is going to happen,” remarked Bob one
afternoon, as he tossed aside the book he had
been trying to study, while Ned was plunking
away at a banjo on which he announced he was
going to become an expert player.</p>

<p>“What is going to happen?” asked Jerry.
“Are you going to bang Ned over the head or
put your foot through that perfectly rotten instrument
he’s torturing?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see him try it!” exclaimed Ned,
but he took the precaution to retreat to his own
room, for they were in Jerry’s, as usual.</p>

<p>“No, I rather like that music,” Bob said. “It
is so soothing.”</p>

<p>“Soothing!” howled Jerry. “I’d rather live
next to a boiler factory! But if it isn’t that, Bob,
what is it? Tell us, Mr. Endman, what am
gwine t’ happen?” and Jerry imitated a negro
minstrel.</p>

<p>“Let’s have another feed happen,” suggested
the stout lad. “It’s been a long while since we’ve
done anything but play ball. Let’s have a spread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“And get caught again?” asked Ned. “Not
for mine!”</p>

<p>“We won’t get caught,” said Bob. “We’ve
been so noble and upright lately that the proc
won’t suspect us. And I don’t believe any one
will squeal now. We haven’t done anything
worth mentioning since the picture racket. By
the way, Ned, have you found out who wrote the
card that gave us away?”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m on the track. I’ve eliminated
all but two typewriters now. It was written on
either one of them. I’ve had specimens of writing
from every machine in the building but two.”</p>

<p>“And whose are those?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Frank Watson’s and Proxy’s—or the one
his clerk uses.”</p>

<p>“Great fish-cakes!” cried Bob. “You don’t
suspect Proxy; do you?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. It may have been his clerk,
but I don’t guess so. The only other one is
Frank, and I’ll get the goods on him yet!”</p>

<p>“Well, about the feed,” resumed Bob, “shall
we have it?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Go ahead!” assented Jerry. “Things
have been a bit dull of late.”</p>

<p>“Count me in,” added Ned.</p>

<p>Word was quietly passed around that another
feast was to be given by the three chums, and
invitations to it were eagerly looked for.</p>

<p>“That Chunky sure does know how to get up
an eat-fest,” said Gene Flarity. “Too bad the
last one was spoiled.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t exactly spoiled,” observed
George Fitch. “We had most of the stuff put
away inside us when the proc came in. But I
don’t think any one will squeal this time.”</p>

<p>“If they do, and it proves to be Frank, he ought
to be run out of college,” declared Gene. “It’s
a shame the way he snubs those fellows.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” agreed George. “Well, we’ll hope
for the best.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll get it, if Chunky has the ordering
of the eats,” chuckled Gene. “He was telling me
he was going to make a chicken pie in that electric
chafing dish.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed George. “Chunky is sure
some little cook!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>To the surprise of Ned, Bob and Jerry, who
quietly passed word around about the prospective
surreptitious lunch, members of the varsity nine
whom they asked, refused.</p>

<p>“I’d like to come, first-rate,” said Jake Porter,
“but you see Frank has forbidden us.”</p>

<p>“You mean he won’t let you come just because
we’re giving it?” asked Ned. “Solidified scuttle-butts!
but that is carrying it a long way.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t because it’s <em>you</em>,” Jake hastened
to add. “I’m not even sure he knows you’re going
to give it, unless you asked him.”</p>

<p>“There wouldn’t be any use asking him,” Bob
said.</p>

<p>“Well then, it’s because it’s the night before the
second Kenwell game,” Jake explained. “Frank
says any of the varsity who feed up and stay out
late the night before the game can’t play. So I’m
not going to take a chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that’s all right,” Jerry said. “We
don’t want to spoil the team’s chances. We
haven’t any ourselves, so we’re going to feed up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t suppose it makes an awful lot of
difference,” said Jake. “I can play just as well
after a supper as before. But you know what
Frank is. Once he gets a notion in his head it’s
hard to get it out. So I’m taking no chances.”</p>

<p>“Can’t blame you for that,” remarked Ned.
“And we sure do know what Frank is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat to the surprise of the hosts Bart and
Bill agreed to come to the feast.</p>

<p>“We don’t care what Frank says,” declared
Bart. “I want to have some fun, and we’ll get
it in your rooms. It won’t make a bit of difference
about the game. But don’t let Frank
know we’re coming, or he might be pig-headed
enough to keep us out.”</p>

<p>“We won’t say a word,” promised Bob.</p>

<p>“But how are you going to get in without his
knowing it, seeing that you’re bunking with him?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can slip out on some excuse or other,”
Bill said. “I’m not going to let him slave-drive
me much longer.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get into our rooms without his seeing
you,” went on Jerry. “He’s likely to come
out in the hall any minute.”</p>

<p>“Hush! Whisper!” exclaimed Bart, with a
wink. “The fire escape! There’s one outside
Ned’s window; isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Ned cried. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll crawl up the fire escape from the outside,”
went on Bart, “and you be ready to let us
in your window.”</p>

<p>“But it may be risky going back that way,”
cautioned Bob. “The moon won’t be up when you
come in, but it will be shining directly on the ladder
when the party breaks up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, going out will be easy,” declared Bill.
“You can let us slip out of your rooms into the
corridor. We can go down it a way on our tiptoes
and come back flat-footed so Frank will hear
us. He’ll think we’re coming back from a trip
to town, where we can intimate that we’re going.”</p>

<p>“Any way you like,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>The night of the feast came. It was the night
before the second big game with Kenwell.</p>

<p>To the rooms of our friends came those invited
to the feast. All but Bart and Bill arrived
in the usual way, stepping softly along the corridor.
If Frank, in his den across the hall, knew
that a feast was going on he gave no sign. Not
a light showed over the transom.</p>

<p>“He went out before we did,” said Bart when
he and Bill arrived by way of the fire escape.
“I guess we’ve got him fooled all right.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” returned Jerry.</p>

<p>“And now for the chicken pie!” said Bob,
when some of the other things had been passed
around and the fun was under way.</p>

<p>“‘Hurrah for the fun, is the pudding done?
Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!’” quoted Bart.</p>

<p>“Not so loud!” cautioned Bob, turning the electric
current on in the chafing dish.</p>

<p>“Circulate the olives, somebody!”</p>

<p>“Who’s holding those cocoanut macaroons?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“Somebody’s got a mortgage on the chocolate
cake!”</p>

<p>“Say, but this is a good feed, Chunky!”</p>

<p>Thus came the comments, mostly in whispers,
though now and then a laugh would break out
which would be quickly hushed.</p>

<p>“Smells good, Chunky,” said Bill, when the
stout lad took the cover off the chafing dish.</p>

<p>“I hope it is,” Bob remarked, carefully inspecting
his concoction. “I guess it’s done.”</p>

<p>“Then hurry up and dish it out and we’ll beat
it,” Bart said. “I don’t want Frank to get suspicious.”</p>

<p>Bart and Bill were served with the chicken pie
and were about to begin eating, when there came
a knock on Jerry’s door.</p>

<p>“Caught again!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Who—who’s there?” faltered Bob, while
Jerry reached up and switched off the lights.</p>

<p>“It’s Frank Watson,” was the unexpected answer.
“Open the door.”</p>

<p>Wondering what was in the wind Jerry turned
on the incandescents, while Ned swung open the
portal which he unlocked.</p>

<p>“Are Bart and Bill here?” demanded Frank,
haughtily, not coming in. “I thought so,” he went
on, as he caught sight of the two members of the
varsity. “I told you fellows to cut this out,” he
went on. “I don’t object to a little fun, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
know it’s the night before a big game, and I don’t
want you trying to play with stomach-aches. Come
on out now!” he ordered, harshly.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, within his right as captain and
manager, and Bart and Bill realized it.</p>

<p>“Can’t we finish this pie?” asked Bart.</p>

<p>“No! You’re in training, the same as the rest
of us. I’m not breaking mine, and you shouldn’t
yours. It isn’t fair.”</p>

<p>“Will you come in?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“No!” Frank fairly snapped. “And you fellows
come out!”</p>

<p>Bob wanted to ask how Frank knew of the
presence of the two varsity men in the room, but
did not think it wise. After all, it was not hard
for Frank to guess, since he could not have been
unaware of the fact that a supper was in progress
across the hall.</p>

<p>Bart and Bill went out.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose you have any objections to the
rest of our guests remaining, have you?” asked
Jerry, slightly sarcastically.</p>

<p>“No!” Frank answered shortly. He went into
his own room, followed by Bart and Bill.</p>

<p>“I guess he won’t squeal,” said Ned. “We’ll
finish the feed.”</p>

<p>It was the day of the second game with Kenwell.
A big crowd surged in the stands around
the diamond at Boxwood Hall. The rival rooters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
sang, yelled and cheered, and there was a
riot of college and academy colors.</p>

<p>“Is Frank going to let Bart and Bill play?”
asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard,” replied Ned. He, as well
as Jerry, Bob and other members of the scrub,
were in baseball suits, for a game with the Kenwell
scrub would follow the main contest.</p>

<p>But a little later when the Boxwood Hall varsity
ran out of the dressing room it was seen that
Bart and Bill had not been penalized.</p>

<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>Again sounded that thrilling and inspiring call.</p>

<p>At first it seemed that the Boxwood Hall team
had a good chance. But Kenwell was more on
edge, and slipped over two runs the first inning,
while the college lads had only a goose egg.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s early yet,” said Jerry, who sat with
the other scrubs.</p>

<p>But when it came Boxwood Hall’s turn they
could do little against “Sock” Burchell’s pitching,
finding him only for fouls.</p>

<p>It was in the fourth inning that the real break
came. The score was three to one in favor of
the academy. And then it was that the military
lads cut loose.</p>

<p>They literally pounded Jim Blake out of the
box, and though Frank raged around, and did his
best, it was too much for him. The man on first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
missed two easy balls, and as for the short stop
he let three easy grounders get past him. The
academy brought in five runs that inning and it
looked to be all up with Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>And then the rooters took a hand.</p>

<p>“Get a pitcher!”</p>

<p>“Put somebody in without a glass arm!”</p>

<p>“Get a new man on first!”</p>

<p>“Where’d that short stop learn to play ball?”</p>

<p>“Frank, you’ve got to do something!” cried
Bart to his chum when Kenwell was finally put
out.</p>

<p>“What can I do? The team’s playing rotten.”</p>

<p>“I know. But put in some fellows who can
play. There’s Hopkins, Slade and Baker. You
know they can play. They may pull us out of the
hole and we might win with Ned’s pitching. Put
’em in!”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>From the crowd of rooters came the demands.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Jerry Hopkins?”</p>

<p>“Can’t Ned Slade curve ’em over?”</p>

<p>The crowd was becoming unruly. Several
shouted unpleasant names at Frank.</p>

<p>“You’re a peach of a captain!”</p>

<p>“Better put the three in,” advised Bill Hamilton.
“They’ll put some pep in the team.”</p>

<p>Frank’s face showed his anger. He hesitated,
while the roar from the crowd increased.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</a><br />
<small>IN THE TENTH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Play ball!”</p>

<p>“Go on with the game!”</p>

<p>“We can’t stay here all day!”</p>

<p>These and other calls were coming not only
from the mere spectators of the game, but from
the students of the military academy who had come
to root for their side. Some of the Boxwood Hall
boys, especially those who liked Jerry and his
chums, and who did not have much use for the
high-handed methods of Frank Watson, added
their voices to the din.</p>

<p>“Better put ’em in,” suggested Bart, nodding
toward our heroes, who, in their uniforms, sat on
the scrub bench, not a little embarrassed by the
attention they were attracting.</p>

<p>“You mind your own——” began Frank angrily,
when Oscar Durand, the captain of the Kenwell
team, stepped forward.</p>

<p>“Say,” he remarked in his slow, good-natured
drawl, “go on and put in all the new men you want
to. We don’t care. We’ll play a whole new team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
if you say so. Only do something, and don’t delay
the game.”</p>

<p>Frank still hesitated. It was clear that he hated
to give in to the boys whom he so disliked, but
still he was enough of a ball player to realize that
unless something were done Boxwood Hall would
go down to defeat.</p>

<p>“Play ball!” came the insistent cries from the
stands.</p>

<p>Ted Newton, the football hero of the school,
hastened out to the sullen baseball captain.</p>

<p>“Put the three in, Frank,” he said. “It’s your
only chance.”</p>

<p>Ted was chairman of the athletic advisory
board, and he had much influence. Frank felt that
his position was a shaky one.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said, sullenly. “I’ll let ’em play.
Come on, Hopkins—Slade—Baker!” he called.
“Get in the game.”</p>

<p>“Am I to pitch?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p>“And I hope you do better than I did,” remarked
Jim Blake good-naturedly. He was
enough of a real sport to put the team ahead of
himself.</p>

<p>“I ought to have a little warm-up practice before
I go in,” Ned suggested.</p>

<p>“Get over there and practice,” said Frank.
“We’re at bat now, and Jake Porter can catch for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
you. No, I’d better do it myself, as I’m going to
be behind the plate.”</p>

<p>Frank was a good catcher, and it must be admitted
that he had not been at fault so far in the
contest. It was the other players. And once he
had made up his mind to play our three heroes, he
did not do it half-heartedly.</p>

<p>He did not act in a friendly manner toward
Ned, but in practice he put forth his best efforts,
and urged the new pitcher to do his best to “sting
them in,” which Ned did.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, we’re out to win!” exclaimed
Frank, when Charlie Moore went up to bat to
open the fifth inning, Kenwell having won the toss,
and, as usual, chosen to go up last.</p>

<p>The mere fact that Ned, Bob and Jerry had
been put in the game seemed to have inspired confidence
at once, for Charlie, who was a notoriously
poor hitter, singled for the first time in a long
while, and went to first amid cheers. And when
Jerry knocked a three bagger, bringing Charlie in,
and adding to the slender score of Boxwood Hall,
there was a riot of cheers on the stands opposite
those occupied by the military lads. Then another
single by Sid Lenton brought in Jerry, and
made the score eight to three, in favor of Kenwell.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we’ll pull up all right,” said Jim
Blake, from his position in retirement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a lot to do yet,” Ted Newton reminded
him. “The game is a good way from
being in the ice-box, as far as Boxwood Hall is
concerned. But those three fellows are going to
help a lot.”</p>

<p>Two runs that inning was all the rivals of the
academy could bring in, the succeeding batters being
pitched out by “Sock.” But when Boxwood
took the field for the last half of the fifth there
was a different atmosphere. Boxwood Hall’s team
had “tightened up,” and the same might be said
of the military academy players, for they realized
they had to meet some snappy players.</p>

<p>“Hold ’em down, Ned,” begged Bob, as he
went to his position at shortstop.</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Ned.</p>

<p>“And don’t you make any wild throws,
Chunky,” cautioned the tall lad on first.</p>

<p>“You watch me,” Bob remarked.</p>

<p>However, for all his promise, he nearly brought
disaster in the next few minutes of play. For a
bounding ball came his way, and though he scooped
it up in a clever catch that earned him applause, he
threw it so high to Jerry that the tall lad had to
leap in the air, and spear it down with one hand.</p>

<p>That he got it was due not only to luck, but to
efficient playing, and as he came down on the bag
with one foot just in time to catch the runner
out, a yell of approval arose from the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything did not go as well as that, though,
for one of the fielders missed an easy fly, thereby
being indirectly responsible for letting in a run,
making Kenwell nine. But that was all they got
that inning—Ned pitching some wonderful ball,
and retiring two men in succession without letting
them even foul.</p>

<p>“Well, at that rate, we won’t beat ’em,” said
Bob, gloomily, as his side came in to bat. “We’ve
got four more innings to play, and if we get two
runs each inning that will make eight for us, or a
total of eleven. They’ve got nine now, and one
run in each of the four left will make them thirteen——”</p>

<p>“Which is unlucky,” broke in Jerry.</p>

<p>“I’d like to be unlucky that way,” said Ned.
“Well, we’ll hope for the best.”</p>

<p>It did look a little more hopeful when, instead
of two, Boxwood Hall got three runs that inning,
making their tally six, as against nine.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a chance!” exclaimed Frank, and
he seemed to smile at Jerry and his chums. But
he did not offer them a friendly word.</p>

<p>There was much excitement now. Both teams
were “playing their heads off,” and the rooters,
the cheerers and the coherents on either side were
sending out song after song, and yell after yell.
If Boxwood Hall could win the game it meant that
she would have an even chance for the local championship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
for a third game with Kenwell would
have to be played.</p>

<p>It was in the ninth inning that Boxwood Hall
tied the score. For by dint of wonderful playing
on the part of the whole team, and by a thrilling
exhibition of pitching on the part of Ned, Kenwell
had been allowed only two more runs, making
their score eleven, and now, in their half of the
ninth, Jerry and his chums had tied it.</p>

<p>“If we can hold ’em down the remainder of
this inning, it will mean another chance,” cried
Bob. “We’ll have to play ten innings.”</p>

<p>And a ten inning game it proved to be. For
not a Kenwell lad got farther than second base.</p>

<p>Up to the plate in the tenth inning came Bob.
He was not a sure hitter, but he got his base on
balls, and the crowd started gibing the academy
pitcher. But he tightened up and struck out the
next man. Then came Jerry.</p>

<p>“Another three bagger!” begged the Boxwood
lads. Jerry smiled confidently and let the first
ball go by.</p>

<p>“Strike!” snapped out the umpire.</p>

<p>“Oh you robber!” howled the crowd.</p>

<p>The next was a ball, and the next—well, they
talk about it yet at Boxwood Hall. For Jerry
with all his might and main smote the horsehide
spheroid squarely on the “nose” and then he ran.
And Bob spun around the bases too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Home run! Home run! Home run!” yelled
the wild lads.</p>

<p>The ball Jerry knocked went deep into centre
field, and the frantic fieldsman raced back after
it. On and on ran Jerry. Ahead of him sped
Bob. And <a href="#image01">as Bob crossed home plate with his run,
Jerry was not far behind him</a>. Nor was the ball
a great way off, for it thumped into the hands of
Ford Tatum, the catcher, with a vicious thump.
But the umpire cried “Safe!” and Boxwood Hall
had two more runs.</p>

<p>The score was thirteen to eleven, and only one
man was out. But that was the best Boxwood Hall
could do. “Sock” disposed of his next two rivals
in short order.</p>

<p>“And now if we can hold ’em down—hold ’em
down!” murmured Jerry as they went to the field,
and Kenwell came up for its last raps.</p>

<p>It looked like another break when Ned gave
two men their base on balls, but then his nerve asserted
itself. Amid a riot of calls, designed to
disconcert him, he stood his ground, and he and
Frank put up a game that made a new record for
efficiency. For not a man got a hit in the last
half of the tenth, and a goose egg went up in that
frame for Kenwell, while the score stood</p>

<p>Boxwood Hall had won the second game of
the important series in the tenth inning. It was
game and game—a third one would be necessary
to decide the championship. And as the rooters
of the victorious side realized this, and as they
thought of what snap and ginger Ned, Bob and
Jerry had put into the team at the crucial moment,
there came glad shouts and cries.</p>

<p>The winning team had cheered its losing rivals,
and in turn, to show their sporting spirit, the military
lads had responded. Then out on the diamond
swarmed the Boxwood Hall rooters.</p>

<p>“Oh you Jerry Hopkins!”</p>

<p>“Oh you Bob Baker!”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Ned Slade, our peerless
pitcher!” called one enthusiast.</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, and the boys
thronged around our three heroes, patting them on
the back, hugging them, trying to shake hands with
them and lead them about in a wild snake dance.</p>

<p>Ted Newton saw a dark and scowling look on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Frank Watson’s face. He did some quick thinking.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for our captain!” he called.
“The pluckiest baseball captain Boxwood Hall
ever had.”</p>

<p>And the cheer that followed brought a smile
even to Frank’s dour face. Ted had guessed rightly—that
Frank was getting jealous of the popularity
of the three chums, and Ted did not desire
this, for he wanted to see all enmity wiped out.</p>

<p>“Great work, old man!” exclaimed Jim Blake,
the deposed pitcher, as he shook hands with Ned.
“I was certainly off form to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you’ll be all right next time,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>The celebration over the victory proceeded,
yells, cheers and songs being intermingled. The
vanquished hastened away, not a little down-hearted,
for after their decisive victory in the first
game they had looked for a walkover in the second
one. And they would have found it only for
the timely playing of Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>One might have thought that he would have
given credit where it was due, but Frank did not.
He did not approach the three lads he had publicly
said he would make eat humble pie.</p>

<p>“Say, old man, don’t you think it’s about time
you made up?” asked Bart, linking his arm in that
of Frank as he walked with him off the diamond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Make up with whom?”</p>

<p>“With Jerry and his friends. They pulled us
out of a hole to-day, and——”</p>

<p>“I’m willing to admit that,” broke in Frank.
“I’ll give them all the credit in the world for playing
ball, but, personally, I don’t care to have anything
to do with them.”</p>

<p>“That’s no way to feel,” added Bill Hamilton.</p>

<p>“What is it to you how I feel?” snapped Frank.
“You let me alone! I’m willing to have them play
on the team, because they can put up a good game.
But beyond that I won’t go!”</p>

<p>Frank was as obstinate as ever. Bart and Bill
were about to give up, for the time being, the attempt
to reconcile Frank to the three chums, when
Ted Newton, having overheard what was going
on, took a hand.</p>

<p>“Frank, you’re all wrong in this,” said the football
hero, as he and Bart and Bill, with the baseball
captain walked off to one side. “You’re making
a big mistake!”</p>

<p>“Well then, let me make it!” exclaimed Frank,
angrily. “I wish you’d let me alone! I know my
own business. I know what I’m going to do. I
say I won’t be friends with those fellows, and I
won’t. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>Ted shrugged his shoulders, and did not know
what to answer. At this moment, off among a little
group of lads, a voice was heard saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>“There he is—right over there!”</p>

<p>A hand pointed to where Frank stood disputing
with Bart, Bill and Ted, and a man, detaching himself
from those who had evidently been giving him
directions, approached the baseball captain.</p>

<p>“Hello, Frank!” he cried in jolly tones, holding
out his hand. “I hear you just won a big game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hello, Dad!” Frank cried, his face lighting
up with surprised pleasure, in strange contrast
to the former looks that disfigured it. “Say, I
wish you could have been here. It was great!
We’ve tied Kenwell now. When’d you arrive?”</p>

<p>“Just a little while ago. I had a blowout and
it delayed me, otherwise I’d have been here, as I
wrote you.”</p>

<p>The two linked arms and walked away, showing
mutual affection more like two brothers or
chums than any other relationship.</p>

<p>“That’s Frank’s stepfather,” said Bart. “They
surely are fond of each other.”</p>

<p>“Frank would do anything for him, so I’ve
heard him say,” remarked Bill. “But there’s no
use trying to get Frank to do anything about Jerry
and his chums.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not,” agreed Ted.</p>

<p>Frank and his stepfather, walking toward college,
saw three lads approaching them. It was
Ned, Bob and Jerry, and just now Frank would
have preferred not to encounter them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Frank made as if to turn to one side, but his
stepfather, taking a second look at our heroes, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hold on a moment, son. I know those lads!”</p>

<p>“Know them?” gasped Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes. Hello there!” he cried. “Aren’t you
Jerry Hopkins, Ned Slade and Bob Baker?”</p>

<p>For a moment neither of the three chums answered.
Then looks of recognition came over
their faces.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hobson!” Jerry fairly shouted. “Mr.
Hobson!”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” went on Frank’s stepfather,
laughing. “I’ve got a pretty good memory for
faces. I never expected to see you at Boxwood
Hall. Frank, you know these lads, of course?”</p>

<p>“I—er—I—that is—Oh, yes, of course.”</p>

<p>Frank was ill at ease. But his stepfather, Mr.
Hobson, went on, not seeming to notice.</p>

<p>“Frank,” he said, “I want you to shake hands
with three of the pluckiest lads in the world.
When I had an accident some time ago—when
my auto left the road, rolled down a bank, pinned
me under it and then got on fire—these lads raised
it off me and got me out in time to save my life.
Shake hands with Ned, Bob and Jerry, Frank, and
thank ’em for your dad’s life.”</p>

</div>


<p>Frank Watson’s face was a study in emotions
as he stood beside his stepfather, confronting
Ned, Bob and Jerry. He tried to speak, but,
for a moment, could not.</p>

<p>“You boys must have shaken hands a lot of
times already,” went on Mr. Hobson, “but shake
again, Frank, and I will too, for it isn’t every day
I have my life saved, you know,” and he laughed,
though there was deep feeling in his words.</p>

<p>“They saved your life?” asked Frank hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“That’s what they did—from my burning auto.
And they put out the fire, too, and saved the machine.
I got it back from the garage all right,
Jerry,” he went on. “Much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>Frank held out his hand toward the tall lad.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I—I—er—I guess I’ve been just a
plain cad,” Frank confessed with a shame-faced
air. “Will you shake?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” cried Jerry heartily, and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
hands met in a firm clasp. In turn Ned and Bob
shook hands with the baseball captain.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked Mr. Hobson.
“Weren’t you boys—Didn’t you know one another—and
playing on the college nine?” he cried.</p>

<p>“It’s a long story, Dad,” broke in Frank.
“Come up to my room—you too, Jerry, Ned and
Bob,” he went on, “and we’ll talk it out. I’ve been
a big fool, I guess, but I’m done now. Come on.”</p>

<p>He linked one arm with Jerry, the other with
Mr. Hobson, while the latter held on to Ned and
Ned to Bob, and in this fashion they marched off
the baseball field.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” cried
Bart, seeing what had happened.</p>

<p>“Frank has made up with the three inseparables!”
exclaimed Bill.</p>

<p>“It’s the best thing that could have happened,
but I don’t know how it came about,” added
Ted Newton.</p>

<p>The story of the reconciliation was soon known
all through the college.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, up in Frank’s room, a scene was
taking place that brought out many feelings and
emotions. Mr. Hobson told Frank all about the
rescue, and then Frank, brushing aside his stubborn
will and pride, told of the wrong impression
he had conceived regarding our heroes and of his
holding aloof from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, well!” exclaimed Mr. Hobson. “I guess
it’s a good thing I came along. I wrote you,
Frank, about three lads getting me out of a bad
predicament, but I didn’t give you all the particulars,
for I was too busy to write much, traveling
all over the West.”</p>

<p>“And you never mentioned their names,” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“No, I guess I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“And we never knew Mr. Hobson was your
stepfather,” added Jerry. “In fact, we never
heard that your stepfather’s name was Hobson.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess I was too uppish to let you hear
much of me,” returned Frank, with a laugh. “But
it will be different from now on. We’ll be friends;
won’t we?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” chorused Jerry and Bob, as they shook
hands all around.</p>

<p>“But you won’t squeal on us any more when we
have a midnight spread, or hoist the sacred picture
on the flagpole; will you?” Ned demanded.</p>

<p>Frank’s face flushed.</p>

<p>“I did squeal on you about that first spread,
and I gave the proctor the key,” he confessed,
“and I’m mighty sorry I did it. I was just mad.
But I didn’t squeal about the picture!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t?” cried Ned. “Then who did?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Frank replied, “but I don’t believe
it was any of the fellows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” Ned declared.</p>

<p>There was an impromptu celebration of the
victorious nine that evening, and Proctor Thornton
was conveniently absent. Mr. Hobson was a
guest of honor, and Frank, in a graceful speech,
admitted his error in regard to the three chums,
and announced that hereafter they would be his
closest friends.</p>

<p>“And will they play in the last game against
Kenwell?” some one asked.</p>

<p>“That’s what they will!” Frank answered,
heartily.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll cinch the championship!”</p>

<p>Nothing outside the college routine happened
in the following week at Boxwood Hall; but Frank
and the three chums let their friendship grow,
and the reconciliation meant much to both sides.
Never before had the spirit of the college so manifested
itself.</p>

<p>Mr. Hobson announced that he would stay to
see the deciding game between Boxwood and Kenwell,
which would take place on the Boxwood Hall
grounds, they having won the toss.</p>

<p>“Luck sure is with us,” said Frank to Jerry
when this matter had been settled. “Now we’ve
got a week to do some hard practicing, and we
must work hard, for we want to beat ’em bad.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best,” Jerry answered.</p>

<p>Seldom before had there been such a baseball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
team at Boxwood. Ned, Bob and Jerry seemed
to fit right in the places of the lads who were deposed,
at least temporarily, to make room for
them. And the best of it was that there was no
ill feeling. The lads who were not allowed to
play rooted just as hard for the team as before.</p>

<p>Kenwell, it was said, was strengthening her nine,
and the final game was likely to prove an exciting
and hard one. Meanwhile, the talk of the college,
when it was not about baseball, was about
the reconciliation between Frank Watson and the
chums.</p>

<p>It was the day of the great game. The stands
on the Boxwood Hall diamond were filled with
students, girls, men and women, for it was a big
attraction, this championship contest, and drew
from all over the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Song after song welled from the rival factions.
Cheer followed cheer. There were cheers for the
clashing teams, and for the individual players.
There were cheers for the rival captains, and “skyrockets,”
and “locomotives” without number.</p>

<p>Out on the field ran the Boxwood Hall nine
and the substitutes, to be received with yells of
gladness. Then came the Kenwell lads, and they,
too, were riotously welcomed.</p>

<p>There was some batting and pitching practice,
and it was noted that Kenwell was “warming” up
a new twirler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’re out to do us,” murmured Frank. “Do
your best, Ned!”</p>

<p>“I sure will, Cap!”</p>

<p>“Play ball!” called the umpire.</p>

<p>Only for a few minutes did it look bad for Boxwood
Hall. This was in the third inning. Up to
this time neither side had scored. Then two pinch
hitters were sent in, who found Ned to the extent
of two runs, putting the military lads that much
ahead of scoreless Boxwood Hall.</p>

<p>“Things aren’t breaking right,” murmured the
Boxwood Hall rooters.</p>

<p>“Just you wait,” advised Ted Newton.</p>

<p>The break came when “Sock” Burchell was replaced
by the new man. Either he was not a good
pitcher, or his rivals were on to his curves, for
Boxwood Hall saw her opportunity and grasped
it, and she tallied seven runs in that inning.</p>

<p>From then on it was a walkover for Frank’s
team. Kenwell fought staunchly every inch of the
way, but when the first half of the ninth inning
ended, with the military lads at the bat and the
score fourteen to four against them, the struggle
was over. Boxwood Hall had won the championship,
and in the main it was due to the sensational
work of Ned, Bob and Jerry. For at a critical
moment Jerry had pulled off a double play that
seemed to take the heart out of his opponents.</p>

<p>“’Rah for Boxwood Hall!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Boxwood Hall wins!”</p>

<p>“The championship is ours!”</p>

<p>Out on the field swarmed the rooters to surround
and cheer the team. Frank clasped the
hand of Jerry Hopkins.</p>

<p>“Great work, old man!” he cried.</p>

<p>“It was great work all around!” declared Ted
Newton.</p>

<p>And so it was.</p>

<p>Once more cheer followed cheer, yell succeeded
yell, and song echoed song, as the victorious ones
paraded about the field, while the vanquished silently
withdrew. Never before had Boxwood
Hall so decisively beaten its ancient rival.</p>

<p>It marked the practical end of the baseball season,
for spring was merging into summer, and the
long vacation was at hand.</p>

<p>There was a feast that night, given by Frank to
the team, for training was over, and among the
first names proposed for a toast by the captain
were those of Ned, Bob and Jerry.</p>

<p>“Three good cheers for the motor boys!” cried
Frank, and the room echoed with the sound that
followed.</p>

<p>It was a week after the big game when Ned,
his face showing his excitement, came mysteriously
to his two chums.</p>

<p>“I’ve found it! I’ve found it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Found what?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“The typewriter on which the note that gave
us away about the picture stunt was printed.”</p>

<p>“You have? Whose was it?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“The proctor’s! Look, there’s a specimen of
work from his machine and here’s the card with
our names on it.”</p>

<p>Ned laid them down side by side, and, as he
told how he had secured the sample by the use
of a little subterfuge, his two chums noted the similarity
of slight marks in letters that seemed to
prove the point. And, a little later, it was proved
positively.</p>

<p>For the proctor sent for our heroes one day.</p>

<p>“I understand you think that a certain student
here gave information to the faculty to the effect
that you three took down the founder’s picture.
Never mind how I found it out, but do you hold
that belief?” he asked.</p>

<p>“We did,” answered Ned, “but we don’t now.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” the proctor said, “for it was
I who saw you. As I was too late to prevent your
carrying your prank to completion to save Dr.
Boxwood’s portrait from desecration, I wrote the
note and put it on the flagpole.”</p>

<p>“We know that, too,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“How did you find it out?” asked the proctor.</p>

<p>“We respectfully decline to tell,” and Ned
bowed, smiling.</p>

<p>The proctor hesitated a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very well. But don’t try such tricks again.”</p>

<p>“And so that mystery is solved,” observed
Jerry, as they came out of the office. “I wonder
what will happen next?”</p>

<p>And what did will be related in our next volume,
to be called, “Ned, Bob and Jerry on a Ranch;
Or, The Motor Boys Among the Cowboys.”</p>

<p>“Boys, I want to congratulate you on your
basketball victory,” said Professor Snodgrass,
some days after the diamond championship had
been decided. “I understand that the eleven did
well.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jerry, trying not to laugh, “we
did.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Bob a few days after this,
as he lay sprawling on a couch in his room, “this
is no fun, fellows. Let’s do something.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Jerry from his apartment where
he and Ned were playing checkers.</p>

<p>“Let’s go eat!” broke in Ned.</p>

<p>“Exactly!” agreed Bob, and Ned had to dodge
the book the stout lad heaved at him.</p>

<p>But they presently went off to the dining hall,
and there we will take leave of Ned, Bob and
Jerry.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
